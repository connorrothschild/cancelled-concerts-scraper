When he tried to call Live Nation about a refund, he was directed back to the Red Sox, or the MLB Ticket Exchange. Healy says he spent hours on the phone and couldn‚Äôt get a straight answer. ‚ÄúNobody at the Red Sox, Live Nation or MLB would give us a straight answer on how we‚Äôre gonna get our money back,‚Äù he said. Live Nation tells WBZ that they are offering refunds for concerts that have been rescheduled or canceled, but the Red Sox say only two acts, James Taylor and Dead and Company, have officially canceled or postponed their shows at Fenway. Until the other eight acts make an official announcement, Ken‚Äôs refunds appear to be in limbo. He now wonders if Mayor Marty Walsh needs to step in. ‚ÄúDo we need Mayor Walsh to tell Live Nation, ‚Äòhey your concerts are canceled?‚Äô‚Äô Live Nation created the Ticket Refund Plan to give fans refund options for shows that have been cancelled or rescheduled. It takes an entire ecosystem to bring live events to life,¬†we appreciate the patience of fans as our teams work through the details of shifting these shows with artists, venues, and communities around the world.¬†For more information visit¬†LiveNation.com/refund.‚Äú IF mlb does get an 82 game schedule together and it will be fanless games then they need to pull the plug on all the concerts as well. If it‚Äôs not safe to attend a mlb game then it‚Äôs certainly not safe to attend a concert at the same venue. Live Nation, Ticketmaster or whoever needs to get the refunds going now. So now the Maroon 5 website says it was postponed. You will receive an email as soon as the new date is confirmed. Please hold on to your tickets as they will be honored accordingly.Nothing about a refund.Hey Nick Edmonds ‚Äì make some noise on this! PLEASE I just received the notification for Guns & Roses‚Ä¶no refunds until AFTER they announce the reschedule date.  How can that be possible‚Ä¶could be a year before that happens!?!?!  There has to be a way around this‚Ä¶we shouldn‚Äôt have to have our money tied up like that‚Ä¶. I agree. I spent over $700 on 4 Gaga tickets in NJ. I cannot see any way holding the show would be safe. Not a word from our governor about making them cancel so we could get a refund. I checked here to see if things were better in Boston, but it is the same situation. üò† This is insane!  I will be traveling from Texas for this show.  I have not only concert tickets, but airfare tied up in this mess.  I wish they would just cancel it and offer a refund as a courtesy, not everyone is going to be afforded the luxury of being able to come at a later date.  Cancel the show and get the refunds back to the ticket buyers."

The Department is receiving an increasing number of complaints and inquiries from ticketed passengers, including many with non-refundable tickets, who describe having been denied refunds for flights that were canceled or significantly delayed. ¬†In many of these cases, the passengers stated that the carrier informed them that they would receive vouchers or credits for future travel. Because the COVID-19 public health emergency has had an unprecedented impact on air travel, DOT‚Äôs Aviation Enforcement Office will exercise its enforcement discretion and provide carriers with an opportunity to become compliant before taking further action. ¬†However, the Aviation Enforcement Office will monitor airlines‚Äô refund policies and practices and take enforcement action as necessary. ¬†The notice can be found here: https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/enforcement-notice-regarding-refunds-carriers-given-unprecedented-impact-covid-19."

When Lisa DeWitt reached out about a refund, she was told no refunds would be offered ‚Äî her tickets would instead be good for the 2021 festival. That original Facebook statement, which she‚Äôd screenshotted, was gone within 24 hours. ‚ÄúThese ‚Äòno refund‚Äô policies, when the event is rescheduled, are clearly noted on our ‚ÄòTicket Information‚Äô language on our website and was a condition of every online sale through Etix,‚Äù the festival‚Äôs website now states. With tens of thousands of concerts, festivals and sporting events shut down from March through the foreseeable future, many consumers are getting antsy about whether they can get refunds for their tickets. On April 17, Ticketmaster President Jarred Smith tweeted that the company does not ‚Äúintend to withhold refunds on postponed shows.‚Äù That has not stopped New York state officials from launching an investigation into whether the company subtly changed its refund policy in the wake of COVID-19. (The company has said it was a clarification, not a change.) And it has not stopped two members of Congress, Democrats Katie Porter and Bill Pascrell Jr., from calling upon Ticketmaster to refund everything. According to Variety, two major promoters, Live Nation and AEG, have initiated a refund program that will kick into place May 1. If a concert is canceled, fans will either be automatically refunded, or in some cases must request a refund. If, however, a concert is postponed to a new date, ticketholders will have 30 days from that point to request a refund through Live Nation-owned sites (like Ticketmaster) or AEG-owned sites (like AXS). Ticketmaster has also said it will waive its seller fees for resale postings created through May 31. In an email, Tampa Bay Blues Festival president Charles Ross said the festival initially tried to refund buyers who couldn‚Äôt attend the rescheduled festival ‚Äúfor serious reasons like medical events, family commitments, etc.,"" but it became ‚Äútoo complicated to interface with the buyers, so we chose to follow our published procedures.‚Äù They did change their policies to allow ticketholders to resell passes to a third party. It doesn‚Äôt feel that way to DeWitt, who has started a private Facebook group, ‚ÄúTBBF We Want Our Refund,‚Äù for ticketholders to vent about the festival‚Äôs refund policy. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what next April is going to bring, and whether or not I can travel from Colorado,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI understand their plight, but they also publicize that they sell out their VIP tickets every year. So why can‚Äôt they just refund our money, like they said they were going to, and sell to someone else?‚Äù In general, tickets purchased for an event that‚Äôs been canceled can be refunded. For most online purchases, that will happen automatically, but it‚Äôs good to confirm that through the retailer or venue. Most tickets to postponed events will be honored on the new date. One caveat: Many organizations have closed or changed their box office hours; those that are open may be dealing with high call volume. And some venues require you to wait until a new date has been announced before inquiring about a refund. So if you can‚Äôt get answers immediately, be patient. Here‚Äôs how some Tampa Bay venues and entities are handling ticket refunds. If there‚Äôs an organization not on this list, and you want to know whether you can get a refund, contact us here, and we‚Äôll try to add it. Amalie Arena: It‚Äôs a confusing time to be a ticketholder at Amalie Arena, between events being postponed, moved, canceled ‚Äî and then there‚Äôs the Lightning, who have their own ticket refund policy. The arena has outlined what‚Äôs going on with each of its events here. Florida Orchestra: The orchestra, like other nonprofits, is encouraging people to consider donating the cost of their ticket, or exchange it for credit for a future performance. But those specifically requesting refunds can get them by contacting (727) 892-3337 or ticketcenter@floridaorchestra.org. The Palladium: The St. Petersburg theater, like a lot of venues, is asking patrons to consider keeping their tickets, exchanging them for credit or donating the cost to its programs. But it is also allowing ticketholders to request refunds. Click here for details. Raymond James Stadium: Refunds are already available for the Sunset Music Festival (see below) and Tampa Bay Vipers.

When Lisa DeWitt reached out about a refund, she was told no refunds would be offered ‚Äî her tickets would instead be good for the 2021 festival. That original Facebook statement, which she‚Äôd screenshotted, was gone within 24 hours. ‚ÄúThese ‚Äòno refund‚Äô policies, when the event is rescheduled, are clearly noted on our ‚ÄòTicket Information‚Äô language on our website and was a condition of every online sale through Etix,‚Äù the festival‚Äôs website now states. With tens of thousands of concerts, festivals and sporting events shut down from March through the foreseeable future, many consumers are getting antsy about whether they can get refunds for their tickets. On April 17, Ticketmaster President Jarred Smith tweeted that the company does not ‚Äúintend to withhold refunds on postponed shows.‚Äù That has not stopped New York state officials from launching an investigation into whether the company subtly changed its refund policy in the wake of COVID-19. (The company has said it was a clarification, not a change.) And it has not stopped two members of Congress, Democrats Katie Porter and Bill Pascrell Jr., from calling upon Ticketmaster to refund everything. According to Variety, two major promoters, Live Nation and AEG, have initiated a refund program that will kick into place May 1. If a concert is canceled, fans will either be automatically refunded, or in some cases must request a refund. If, however, a concert is postponed to a new date, ticketholders will have 30 days from that point to request a refund through Live Nation-owned sites (like Ticketmaster) or AEG-owned sites (like AXS). Ticketmaster has also said it will waive its seller fees for resale postings created through May 31. In an email, Tampa Bay Blues Festival president Charles Ross said the festival initially tried to refund buyers who couldn‚Äôt attend the rescheduled festival ‚Äúfor serious reasons like medical events, family commitments, etc.,"" but it became ‚Äútoo complicated to interface with the buyers, so we chose to follow our published procedures.‚Äù They did change their policies to allow ticketholders to resell passes to a third party. It doesn‚Äôt feel that way to DeWitt, who has started a private Facebook group, ‚ÄúTBBF We Want Our Refund,‚Äù for ticketholders to vent about the festival‚Äôs refund policy. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what next April is going to bring, and whether or not I can travel from Colorado,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI understand their plight, but they also publicize that they sell out their VIP tickets every year. So why can‚Äôt they just refund our money, like they said they were going to, and sell to someone else?‚Äù In general, tickets purchased for an event that‚Äôs been canceled can be refunded. For most online purchases, that will happen automatically, but it‚Äôs good to confirm that through the retailer or venue. Most tickets to postponed events will be honored on the new date. One caveat: Many organizations have closed or changed their box office hours; those that are open may be dealing with high call volume. And some venues require you to wait until a new date has been announced before inquiring about a refund. So if you can‚Äôt get answers immediately, be patient.

Even if your scheduled travel is months away, you might be weighing your options. And many travel service providers seem to be working to address concerns about upcoming trips.¬† Start by reviewing the travel provider‚Äôs refund policies and the terms of your reservation to see your options. In addition, many companies are posting information on their websites about COVID-19 travel-related questions. Many are offering refunds or rebooking options in light of the situation. Of course, check to see if you purchased travel insurance and what it covers. Some travel insurance policies may refund your cancelled trip. Airlines: According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, airlines must offer refunds, including the ticket price and any optional fee charged for cancelled or significantly delayed flights, even when flight disruptions are outside their control. If your airline isn‚Äôt doing that, you can report it to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Cruise Lines: If you booked a cruise, your options will vary by cruise line. Your ticket contract lays out cancellation policies and your rights. For example, you may be offered a refund, or a credit or voucher for a future cruise. If you opt for a credit or voucher, make sure the expiration date is far enough out that you can use it. Read more from the Federal Maritime Commission about your rights and the recourse that might be available to you. Trains: Amtrak is waiving change fees for reservations made before May 31, 2020; you can make changes online at Amtrak.com. For cancellations and refunds, call 1-800-USA-RAIL. Lodging: Some hotel chains may be loosening their cancellation policies, waiving change and cancellation fees that would normally apply to non-refundable rates. Check with the hotel for your options.

SMH Overseas Adventure Travel is a tour company located in Boston that has, within the past 30 days, attempted to unlawfully, unilaterally, and retroactively, amend the Terms and Conditions of its booking contract in order to attempt to refuse issuing cash refunds and only issue vouchers for future travel (even when they canceled the trip).

But what about the flights?   Turkish Airlines is offering a voucher that must be used by early 2021 which won‚Äôt work since I have a teaching position and can‚Äôt travel at that time.     I do have travel insurance .... I booked a trip thru a travel company and airline separately.  I was able to get refunds from both, but not the full refund.  The travel company gave me 75% of trip and told me to file a claim thru my travel insurance, which I did.  I was denied payment from the travel insurance company because the fact that the trip was cancelled by the travel company due to COVID19 restrictions isn't one of the 9 reasons for reimbursement.  If I would of claimed that I was sick, or was in an accident on my way to the airport the claim would of been reimbursed, but there is no provision in the federal insurance policies that these companies follow for when the travel company cancels or for any pandemic.  If it wasn't for the cancellation and countries being closed to travelers, I would of gone on the trip.  Now I am out a good chunk of change.  The airline booking company reimbursed a little under 1/2 of what I paid on the ticket.  How do I get the remaining monies reimbursement, for it isn't a small amount it's around 5000.  I see in all of the fed assistance it's all paid to the companies to help them survive, but it's not coming down to the consumer how is really hit by the loss incurred. Airlines: According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, airlines MUST (emphasis added) offer refunds, including the ticket price and any optional fee charged for cancelled or significantly delayed flights, even when flight disruptions are outside their control. If your airline isn‚Äôt doing that, you can report it to the U.S. Department of Transportation. United Airlines confirmed to me that they issued refunds directly to the travel agency for the two flight upgrades to Europe that my mom purchased through the travel agency and were ticket through United Airlines. The travel agency initially says the flights are not refundable and so my mom is not entitled to any refund. When I enquired with more information, they now say they booked through a consolidator and that the consolidator is ""making an exception but holding back $500 per ticket for the canceled flights"". Given United was able to tell me the name of the company that the refunds were issued to - which is the travel agency (not a another party) - I do not believe there was a consolidator at play here (i.e., the travel agency IS the consolidator in this case). Regardless...the law says that if the airline cancels the flight, they must offer a refund to the ticketed passengers. In this case, the travel agency requested and received the funds and will not return them in full. This is beyond the $500 per person non-refundable deposit that they have already held back for the tour/accomodation portion of the trip as per the travel contract. FTC please provide guidance on how to manage travel agencies who are taking advantage of travelers by taking their  non-refundable deposits and then also holding back airfare refunds for canceled flights. I made out of state vacation reservations and a car rental based on my flight day and time. I am on a tight schedule to pick up my car rental and check into my hotel at specific times (2-hour drive from airport to hotel). I received an email from Southwest Airlines that my Flight was canceled (both to and from destination) and I was moved to a later outbound flight - causing me to miss my car rental time window and earlier return flight causing me to miss my return flight. I received an email stating that I had to call within 3 days of the notification or I couldn't cancel/change my flight w/o penalty. Did not receive a phone call or text message, so I missed the window of opportunity.In addition, my original Hotel reservations have been changed two times now because of the lockdown and now I'm told that if I elect change my reservations again I will have to pay a penalty.How do I get a refund on my Plain Ticket, Hotel and Car Rental? On Christmas day, my niece and I booked our trip to Paris for my birthday and Mother's day weekend through a travel site. For 2 months i have been trying to get a refund for this trip that cost over $2000. The airline offered a voucher but I want a refund. We are not promised tomorrow and if anything happens to us the money is wasted and they've done nothing to earn it. The hotel wants to keep nearly $900 for doing nothing. They promise me a response in 5 days and it's been 30 days. What's worse is that now my niece has lost her job in airline transportation and we really need it. Booked a cruise in late October for May 2020.    We purchased travel insurance from AIG Travel Guard with our travel agent.    The cruise was cancelled, not by us, but by the cruise line.      Now AIG Travel Guard will not issue a refund for the insurance.    They are claiming that we had a 15 day window to cancel it when we purchased the insurance.          They are offering a 2 year voucher assuming we will take a trip during that time.    We do not believe we will and they will pocket our money.     I do not know how they can not refund funds for a service they didn't provide. I have used travel agent to book my tickets. Airlines is offering full refund but travel agent is charging $300 mentioning that its the consolidator fee which they cannot avoid. Anyone in this situation? wondering if its legally allowed that they can charge the amount? Looking to get back my money. I purchased 2 round-trip tickets from JustFly.com to Japan earlier this year to go to the Olympics.  I paid $3,476.66 for 2 tickets, including taxes and agency fees of $115.33.  We would have used ANA from Chicago to Tokyo, and UA coming back from Tokyo to Chicago.  The event was subsequently cancelled, and both All Nippon Airways and United Airlines are offering full refunds, with no fees.  I contacted both airlines and they confirmed that my tickets qualify for refunds.   Their policies are published on their websites.  Based on the e-ticket numbers, times when I purchased tickets, and the timing of our flight schedules, our tickets meet the criteria per ANA's website. JustFly is still saying that my tickets do not meet the criteria and the airlines are not allowing them to refunds.  I have contacted JustFly several times, but they have not refunded me. I, along with 5 other families, booked an all inclusive trip through Costa Rica Experts out of Chicago, IL and spent approximately $15,000 up front.  One friend who didn't go through this travel agent has recouped all her money from tours we were booked on as well so we know refunds are being issued from guides.  The only option this agent is giving us is to book a trip in July 2020 amid a second wave of the virus and border restrictions (as per the CR Embassy and local newspapers).  This travel is agent is aware of the business restrictions, mandatory quarantine, and no tours operating.  Is this even legal and ethical to sell a package that cannot be used in full?  Do we have any recourse? Please hold travel agencies to this same standard. I booked a trip through an agency: they just told me that the trip is cancelled and that the airlines, hotels, and train lines have waived all fees and given a full refund. However, the travel agency won't give a refund - they are giving a credit toward future travel within the next two years. This would be great in normal times - but why should the travel agency get to hold several thousand of my dollars for two years?? I want my money back. In these uncertain times, I could use that cash more than I can use credit for a future vacation.  The FTC may need to step in and instruct travel agencies to give full refunds. Have you had any luck getting a refund? Hotels.com will not refund me $4000 for a canceled trip to Playa Del Carmen in April. The resort was closed and travel was banned but they are saying my reservation said no refunds. I don‚Äôt know how they can stand by that when travel being banned was totally out of everyone‚Äôs hands. I have literally spent 50+ hours on the phone with them, the hotel and my credit card company and everyone is giving me the run around saying it‚Äôs the other party who has to refund me. Even Southwest Airlines only gave me a credit. This has been an absolute nightmare especially at a time when I lost my job due to the virus! I need help and don‚Äôt know who to turn to! If anyone has advice please reach out to me! My travel agency with European headquarters wants 30 euros per ticket to help refund my japan airline ticket. Is that legal? Why I can‚Äôt directly refund it with airline? Before the Coronavirus outbreak, I booked a vacation for July 12-18 for over $2400 (and paid for it in full) using booking.com for a resort owned by Schulstadt Rentals in Panama City Beach FL.  Neither Booking.com or Schulstadt Rentals will give me a refund in light of COVID-19.  Furthermore, I am an ICU RN who works in a critical access area and a major trauma center and cannot take off of work due to Coronavirus Outbreak staffing/increased patients.  Please help me.  $2400 is a lot of money for us and we deserve a refund..."

Joe x  We are very sorry to announce that we are no longer able to move forward with our South American and US tours planned in March & April.  With the postponement of both Lollapalooza and Coachella, we have considered all options to perform our own shows in these cities & still reach our fans, but with local advisories & restrictions in response to COVID-19, it is just not possible. Bans on some international travel have made it impossible for some members of our band & crew to travel to these countries. With these things so constantly changing, we cannot risk not being able to be at home to support and look after the more vulnerable members of our communities and families. With these tours no longer being possible, we have absorbed a huge financial loss, and it has left us in a very challenging position, but we will be around to fight another day. For this, we feel very fortunate.  Our thoughts go out to everyone else who have found themselves in the position of lost work & income over the next few months, including all the hard-working touring crew and artists across the live industry. Also, our thoughts are with the venues, the independent companies, cafes, restaurants, record stores ‚Äì the list is endless. We encourage everyone to support each other, so we can weather this storm.  With regards to the Mexico tour, this is being assessed on a daily basis. If there is any way we can do shows, safely & responsibly, we always will.

Ticketek has made the same commitment for cancelled events.¬† Speaking in general terms as the crisis continued to unfold, NSW Fair Trading commissioner Rose Webb told the ABC, ""if an event organiser has decided to cancel, whatever the circumstance is, you still haven't got what you paid for ‚Äì so you're still entitled to a refund"".¬† ""The refund policy is the same whether we have coronavirus or not: people will get a refund in the event a show is cancelled,"" a spokesperson for the Melbourne International Comedy Festival told the public broadcaster.¬† And Consumer Affairs Victoria media adviser Anna Basil-Jones tells us ""if an event is unable to go ahead due to COVID-19, consumers are entitled to a refund for any services not provided"".  If an event has not been cancelled, but you decide not to go, then you're not entitled to a refund under Australian Consumer Law. ""The only Dark Mofo tickets sold to date are for the Bon Iver concerts on June 12 and 13, which are single events under the marquee of Dark Mofo. In this situation, the concerts to which people have purchased tickets have not changed, been materially altered or cancelled, and so we are not required to provide an automatic refund.¬† ""Although we are not obliged to provide an automatic refund, we are hosting a resale service via the Dark Mofo website for Bon Iver ticket holders who no longer wish to attend, and tickets successfully sold will be refunded. This is our way of assisting ticket holders, giving fans access to legitimate tickets, and mitigating scalping."" If an event has not been cancelled and you decide to not go, you're not entitled to a refund through Australian Consumer Law. That means if you plan not to attend for fear of the virus, or because you're sick yourself, you'd only get a refund if your ticket is resold. ""If it's your decision not to attend ‚Äì even if it's a very unfortunate decision that you made because of being sick ‚Äì that's not anything the ticket seller has done or has caused to happen,"" Webb said in the ABC interview. ""So in that case you wouldn't have the same right to a refund."" Live Performance Australia, the peak body for Australia's live performance industry, has told its members (such as Ticketek) that they should provide refunds for people who are required to self-isolate, but there's no guarantee that all members will comply. Ticketek has a clause in its terms and conditions (known as a force majeure clause) saying that ticket holders are not guaranteed a refund if people are unable to attend due to the outbreak of disease, but Consumer Action Law Centre CEO Gerard Brody has advised ticket holders to demand a refund in any event, since big ticketing companies like Ticketek are members of Live Performance Australia, which has advised its members to provide refunds.¬† And Ticketek has said it will provide refunds.¬† If the event being cancelled is run by a small, community-based group or arts organisation that you wish to continue to show your support for, you could choose not to seek a refund.¬† Ticket Brokers Association of Australia's Joshua Gladwell has gone on record to say resellers are bound by the same laws as primary sellers like Ticketek and Ticketmaster, though some, Viagogo in particular, do not have a good track record of providing refunds.¬† ""Tickets sold by unauthorised sellers are not always legitimate, meaning it may be difficult to get a refund in the event of a cancellation."""

We provide below a summary of key principles and possible considerations in evaluating these issues.  If the event involves the sale of tickets or hospitality suites, the event organizer must consider whether it is required to offer a refund to ticket purchasers if the event is canceled or rescheduled. Several states have statutes that specifically address ticket refund obligations, including New York: Event organizers should keep in mind that even absent a statutory refund requirement, an organization‚Äôs failure to provide a refund, credit or replacement event of comparable value could be challenged as a violation of a state‚Äôs consumer protection law or as a breach of contract under common law. Indeed, a putative class action suit was filed in California against Do Lab, Inc. (DLI), the organizers of the annual Lightning in a Bottle music festival, which was postponed (and potentially canceled) due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The complaint alleges that DLI‚Äôs refusal to provide a refund constitutes an unconscionable contractual term in violation of California‚Äôs Consumer Legal Remedies Act. The plaintiffs also claim that DLI engaged in deceptive business practices by stating in the event‚Äôs terms and conditions that purchasers shall not be entitled to a refund."

Joe x  We are very sorry to announce that we are no longer able to move forward with our South American and US tours planned in March & April.  With the postponement of both Lollapalooza and Coachella, we have considered all options to perform our own shows in these cities & still reach our fans, but with local advisories & restrictions in response to COVID-19, it is just not possible. Bans on some international travel have made it impossible for some members of our band & crew to travel to these countries. With these things so constantly changing, we cannot risk not being able to be at home to support and look after the more vulnerable members of our communities and families.

A spokesman for Eventim said: ‚ÄúIf the respective organizer has canceled the event and has commissioned us to reverse the ticket costs, we will immediately refund the ticket costs to the customer.

Airlines: According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, airlines must offer refunds, including the ticket price and any optional fee charged for cancelled or significantly delayed flights, even when flight disruptions are outside their control. If your airline isn‚Äôt doing that, you can report it to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Cruise Lines: If you booked a cruise, your options will vary by cruise line. Your ticket contract lays out cancellation policies and your rights. For example, you may be offered a refund, or a credit or voucher for a future cruise. If you opt for a credit or voucher, make sure the expiration date is far enough out that you can use it.

Both Frontier and Spirit have refused the numerous requests for refunds---saying flights are nonrefundable.  Both flights were purchased prior to the pandemic.  Neither airline will deny that they are receiving Federal funding but yet neither will refund us, the taxpaying consumer.  So we follow the laws by not flying & the airlines get to keep our money and receive Federal bailout money on top of it all.  SMH Overseas Adventure Travel is a tour company located in Boston that has, within the past 30 days, attempted to unlawfully, unilaterally, and retroactively, amend the Terms and Conditions of its booking contract in order to attempt to refuse issuing cash refunds and only issue vouchers for future travel (even when they canceled the trip).

But what about the flights?   Turkish Airlines is offering a voucher that must be used by early 2021 which won‚Äôt work since I have a teaching position and can‚Äôt travel at that time.     I do have travel insurance .... I booked a trip thru a travel company and airline separately.  I was able to get refunds from both, but not the full refund.  The travel company gave me 75% of trip and told me to file a claim thru my travel insurance, which I did.  I was denied payment from the travel insurance company because the fact that the trip was cancelled by the travel company due to COVID19 restrictions isn't one of the 9 reasons for reimbursement.  If I would of claimed that I was sick, or was in an accident on my way to the airport the claim would of been reimbursed, but there is no provision in the federal insurance policies that these companies follow for when the travel company cancels or for any pandemic.  If it wasn't for the cancellation and countries being closed to travelers, I would of gone on the trip.  Now I am out a good chunk of change.  The airline booking company reimbursed a little under 1/2 of what I paid on the ticket.  How do I get the remaining monies reimbursement, for it isn't a small amount it's around 5000.  I see in all of the fed assistance it's all paid to the companies to help them survive, but it's not coming down to the consumer how is really hit by the loss incurred. Airlines: According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, airlines MUST (emphasis added) offer refunds, including the ticket price and any optional fee charged for cancelled or significantly delayed flights, even when flight disruptions are outside their control. If your airline isn‚Äôt doing that, you can report it to the U.S. Department of Transportation. United Airlines confirmed to me that they issued refunds directly to the travel agency for the two flight upgrades to Europe that my mom purchased through the travel agency and were ticket through United Airlines. The travel agency initially says the flights are not refundable and so my mom is not entitled to any refund. When I enquired with more information, they now say they booked through a consolidator and that the consolidator is ""making an exception but holding back $500 per ticket for the canceled flights"". Given United was able to tell me the name of the company that the refunds were issued to - which is the travel agency (not a another party) - I do not believe there was a consolidator at play here (i.e., the travel agency IS the consolidator in this case). Regardless...the law says that if the airline cancels the flight, they must offer a refund to the ticketed passengers. In this case, the travel agency requested and received the funds and will not return them in full. This is beyond the $500 per person non-refundable deposit that they have already held back for the tour/accomodation portion of the trip as per the travel contract. FTC please provide guidance on how to manage travel agencies who are taking advantage of travelers by taking their  non-refundable deposits and then also holding back airfare refunds for canceled flights. I made out of state vacation reservations and a car rental based on my flight day and time. I am on a tight schedule to pick up my car rental and check into my hotel at specific times (2-hour drive from airport to hotel). I received an email from Southwest Airlines that my Flight was canceled (both to and from destination) and I was moved to a later outbound flight - causing me to miss my car rental time window and earlier return flight causing me to miss my return flight. I received an email stating that I had to call within 3 days of the notification or I couldn't cancel/change my flight w/o penalty. Did not receive a phone call or text message, so I missed the window of opportunity.In addition, my original Hotel reservations have been changed two times now because of the lockdown and now I'm told that if I elect change my reservations again I will have to pay a penalty.How do I get a refund on my Plain Ticket, Hotel and Car Rental? On Christmas day, my niece and I booked our trip to Paris for my birthday and Mother's day weekend through a travel site. For 2 months i have been trying to get a refund for this trip that cost over $2000. The airline offered a voucher but I want a refund. We are not promised tomorrow and if anything happens to us the money is wasted and they've done nothing to earn it. The hotel wants to keep nearly $900 for doing nothing. They promise me a response in 5 days and it's been 30 days. What's worse is that now my niece has lost her job in airline transportation and we really need it. Booked a cruise in late October for May 2020.    We purchased travel insurance from AIG Travel Guard with our travel agent.    The cruise was cancelled, not by us, but by the cruise line.      Now AIG Travel Guard will not issue a refund for the insurance.    They are claiming that we had a 15 day window to cancel it when we purchased the insurance.          They are offering a 2 year voucher assuming we will take a trip during that time.    We do not believe we will and they will pocket our money.     I do not know how they can not refund funds for a service they didn't provide. I have used travel agent to book my tickets. Airlines is offering full refund but travel agent is charging $300 mentioning that its the consolidator fee which they cannot avoid. Anyone in this situation? wondering if its legally allowed that they can charge the amount? Looking to get back my money. I purchased 2 round-trip tickets from JustFly.com to Japan earlier this year to go to the Olympics.  I paid $3,476.66 for 2 tickets, including taxes and agency fees of $115.33.  We would have used ANA from Chicago to Tokyo, and UA coming back from Tokyo to Chicago.  The event was subsequently cancelled, and both All Nippon Airways and United Airlines are offering full refunds, with no fees.  I contacted both airlines and they confirmed that my tickets qualify for refunds.   Their policies are published on their websites.  Based on the e-ticket numbers, times when I purchased tickets, and the timing of our flight schedules, our tickets meet the criteria per ANA's website. JustFly is still saying that my tickets do not meet the criteria and the airlines are not allowing them to refunds.  I have contacted JustFly several times, but they have not refunded me. I, along with 5 other families, booked an all inclusive trip through Costa Rica Experts out of Chicago, IL and spent approximately $15,000 up front.  One friend who didn't go through this travel agent has recouped all her money from tours we were booked on as well so we know refunds are being issued from guides.  The only option this agent is giving us is to book a trip in July 2020 amid a second wave of the virus and border restrictions (as per the CR Embassy and local newspapers).  This travel is agent is aware of the business restrictions, mandatory quarantine, and no tours operating.  Is this even legal and ethical to sell a package that cannot be used in full?  Do we have any recourse? Please hold travel agencies to this same standard. I booked a trip through an agency: they just told me that the trip is cancelled and that the airlines, hotels, and train lines have waived all fees and given a full refund. However, the travel agency won't give a refund - they are giving a credit toward future travel within the next two years. This would be great in normal times - but why should the travel agency get to hold several thousand of my dollars for two years?? I want my money back. In these uncertain times, I could use that cash more than I can use credit for a future vacation.  The FTC may need to step in and instruct travel agencies to give full refunds. Have you had any luck getting a refund? Hotels.com will not refund me $4000 for a canceled trip to Playa Del Carmen in April. The resort was closed and travel was banned but they are saying my reservation said no refunds. I don‚Äôt know how they can stand by that when travel being banned was totally out of everyone‚Äôs hands. I have literally spent 50+ hours on the phone with them, the hotel and my credit card company and everyone is giving me the run around saying it‚Äôs the other party who has to refund me. Even Southwest Airlines only gave me a credit. This has been an absolute nightmare especially at a time when I lost my job due to the virus! I need help and don‚Äôt know who to turn to! If anyone has advice please reach out to me! My travel agency with European headquarters wants 30 euros per ticket to help refund my japan airline ticket. Is that legal? Why I can‚Äôt directly refund it with airline? Before the Coronavirus outbreak, I booked a vacation for July 12-18 for over $2400 (and paid for it in full) using booking.com for a resort owned by Schulstadt Rentals in Panama City Beach FL.  Neither Booking.com or Schulstadt Rentals will give me a refund in light of COVID-19.  Furthermore, I am an ICU RN who works in a critical access area and a major trauma center and cannot take off of work due to Coronavirus Outbreak staffing/increased patients.  Please help me.  $2400 is a lot of money for us and we deserve a refund..."

In response to the criticism, Ticketmaster's parent company, Live Nation, announced an initiative¬†Friday that will give ticketholders 30 days to request a refund once their postponed show sets a new date. If they don't want a refund, their tickets will still be good for the rescheduled show.¬† Live Nation's rival AEG Presents announced a similar 30-day refund program last week, also starting May 1.¬† Eventbrite, another major ticket seller, suggests contacting event organizers directly for details on potential refunds for postponed shows and events.

Instead, it was pushed from June to September.¬† A lot of money is on the line for performers, promoters and venues, which could explain why refunds are hard to get. With concerts expected to be delayed or canceled into the summer, the industry is looking¬†at a minimum projected loss of $10 billion, according to Dave Brooks, Billboard's senior director of live and touring. If the shutdown extends into 2021, it would be even more catastrophic. ""We all talked about whether or not we should get the tickets refunded or wait it out,"" she says. ""We came to the same agreement: Let‚Äôs just get (a refund)."" Their hopes of a refund quickly vanished, though, after several back-and-forths with Ticketmaster representatives, she says.

Though nobody was lining up to sing the praises of major corporations like Live Nation (owner of the broker Ticketmaster) before this unprecedented event, it has shone a light on the lengths to which concert promoters will go to avoid giving concertgoers refunds.  Miami's own Ultra Music Festival was one of the first major events in the nation to be postponed because of the outbreak. It was also one of the first to take advantage of the difference between ""postponed"" and ""canceled."" Ultra effectively canceled its 2020 edition, but rather than refund ticketholders who had shelled out hundreds of dollars to rave in Bayfront Park, organizers ""postponed"" the event until 2021.  Where does that leave disappointed ticket buyers, especially those who need a refund now more than ever in the face of unimaginable financial hardship? Anecdotal accounts have indicated they can get their money back by working directly with banks and credit card companies. But it has been nearly impossible to pin down the effectiveness of that method. No two cases are created equal, as indicated by this real-world scenario: Two friends of mine filed claims with their respective banks at the same time to request refunds to the same event, the 2020 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. Both claimed they wouldn't be able to attend the event, which had been postponed from spring till fall. One received a refund; the other did not. (Last week, the fest was finally canceled, and everyone who had purchased tickets got refunds.) After weeks of increasingly vitriolic backlash from ticket buyers, the nation's two largest concert promoters, Live Nation and AEG, acquiesced and announced plans to offer refunds. But that seemingly simple move is mired in fine-print details, such as the fact that only shows that have been officially rescheduled ‚Äî as opposed to postponed¬†indefinitely¬†‚Äî will be eligible for refunds. That said, below are details about refund policies for South Florida's leading music festivals and the major promoters and ticketing services that handle most concerts. It's no secret that Ticketmaster is the largest ticket broker in the world, and ticketholders have been quick to chastise the Live Nation subsidiary for its hesitation to offer refunds. Even politicians got in on the action: Two Democratic members of Congress wrote a letter to the company that reads, in part, ""With Americans weathering the brutal and continuing impacts of this global crisis, your decision to confiscate their money is reprehensible and should be reversed immediately."" After weeks of silence, both Live Nation and AEG announced a plan to offer refunds for events that have been postponed. Beginning May 1, any events that have been rescheduled with new dates will be eligible for refunds. From that point on, refunds will be available for 30 days beginning from the announcement of the rescheduled date. Visit ticketmaster.com for complete details. This online ticketing service, widely used by smaller venues, is accepting refund requests ‚Äî but only for events that meet a particular set of circumstances. Eligible events must have been canceled, with tickets purchased before March 15, and the event must have been scheduled to take place between March 15 and May 15. Because Eventbrite serves as a middleman between the organizers who list tickets on the website and the buyers who purchase them, the service is also offering details about how to reach out directly to event organizers. Visit eventbrite.com for more information. Because StubHub deals only in the secondary ticket market, obtaining refunds for tickets purchased through the service is even more of a nightmare than with primary sellers. It appears that no matter the status of an event, StubHub users won't get their money back. The website is not offering any resources for those who bought tickets to postponed events, other than to say it will reach out when new event details become available. If an event is canceled, ticketholders will receive a StubHub voucher for 120 percent of the value of the ticket purchased ‚Äî not an actual refund. Visit stubhub.com for details. Ultra was the first U.S. music festival to address the coronavirus crisis, and it did so by controversially ""rescheduling"" its 2020 iteration to 2021, effectively canceling this year's event. It has offered several exclusive benefits to 2020 ticketholders, but it is not offering refunds.  Rolling Loud, pursuing a tack similar to Ultra's, postponed its 2020 festival till February 2021 while keeping the same lineup. The big difference: It's offering refunds. In a statement announcing the new dates, the organizers wrote, ""If you need a refund, don't worry, we got you."" Ticketholders should have received an April 8 email from the festival containing instructions on how to obtain a refund. The Wynwood festival's organizers were working furiously behind the scenes to reschedule this year's event and maintain as much of the lineup as possible ‚Äî an impressive feat amid the turmoil that has overtaken the live-music industry. Unfortunately, the window for festivalgoers to request a refund has closed. All previously purchased tickets are valid for the new, October dates."

This situation is unfounded in our time and to act hastily or irresponsibly now could have very serious repercussions on the mothers of our children or children. That is something we do not fuck with. Thank FUCK for the NHS and those glorious fucking nurses and doctors. We will have a full statement on all up and coming shows soon as things develop. Joe x  We are very sorry to announce that we are no longer able to move forward with our South American and US tours planned in March & April.  With the postponement of both Lollapalooza and Coachella, we have considered all options to perform our own shows in these cities & still reach our fans, but with local advisories & restrictions in response to COVID-19, it is just not possible. Bans on some international travel have made it impossible for some members of our band & crew to travel to these countries. With these things so constantly changing, we cannot risk not being able to be at home to support and look after the more vulnerable members of our communities and families. With these tours no longer being possible, we have absorbed a huge financial loss, and it has left us in a very challenging position, but we will be around to fight another day. For this, we feel very fortunate.  Our thoughts go out to everyone else who have found themselves in the position of lost work & income over the next few months, including all the hard-working touring crew and artists across the live industry. Also, our thoughts are with the venues, the independent companies, cafes, restaurants, record stores ‚Äì the list is endless. We encourage everyone to support each other, so we can weather this storm.  With regards to the Mexico tour, this is being assessed on a daily basis. If there is any way we can do shows, safely & responsibly, we always will. Individual festivals and shows will have specifics on any rescheduled or cancelled dates and information on refunds and tickets. Huge love and respect goes out to all the support and medical staff in our NHS and emergency services all around the world. And to all the people on the front line in controlling and dealing directly with this unprecedented situation we have found ourselves in.  See you on the other side brothers and sisters.

Ticketek has made the same commitment for cancelled events.¬† Speaking in general terms as the crisis continued to unfold, NSW Fair Trading commissioner Rose Webb told the ABC, ""if an event organiser has decided to cancel, whatever the circumstance is, you still haven't got what you paid for ‚Äì so you're still entitled to a refund"".¬† ""The refund policy is the same whether we have coronavirus or not: people will get a refund in the event a show is cancelled,"" a spokesperson for the Melbourne International Comedy Festival told the public broadcaster.¬† And Consumer Affairs Victoria media adviser Anna Basil-Jones tells us ""if an event is unable to go ahead due to COVID-19, consumers are entitled to a refund for any services not provided"".

If an event has not been cancelled and you decide to not go, you're not entitled to a refund through Australian Consumer Law.

Ticketek has a clause in its terms and conditions (known as a force majeure clause) saying that ticket holders are not guaranteed a refund if people are unable to attend due to the outbreak of disease, but Consumer Action Law Centre CEO Gerard Brody has advised ticket holders to demand a refund in any event, since big ticketing companies like Ticketek are members of Live Performance Australia, which has advised its members to provide refunds.¬† And Ticketek has said it will provide refunds.¬† If the event being cancelled is run by a small, community-based group or arts organisation that you wish to continue to show your support for, you could choose not to seek a refund.¬† Ticket Brokers Association of Australia's Joshua Gladwell has gone on record to say resellers are bound by the same laws as primary sellers like Ticketek and Ticketmaster, though some, Viagogo in particular, do not have a good track record of providing refunds.¬† ""Tickets sold by unauthorised sellers are not always legitimate, meaning it may be difficult to get a refund in the event of a cancellation."""

If your flight's still taking off and you're not on it, you're out of luck. The proposed law, backed by five Democrats ‚Äî¬† Edward J. Markey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kamala Harris of California ‚Äî would require both major carriers and third-party ticket sellers to offer full refunds, in cash, for any tickets canceled during the pandemic, whether it was the airline canceling the flight or an individual passenger deciding not to travel. Sen. Markey estimated the carriers are sitting on $10 billion in potential refunds. ""Airlines already have a moral responsibility to give cash refunds for all canceled tickets during the coronavirus pandemic,"" he said. ""People who bought flight tickets and don't get their refund may be in a situation where they suffer financially,"" said Christian Nielsen, chief legal officer at AirHelp. The Berlin-based firm, founded in 2013, has helped 16 million air travelers in 35 countries file compensation claims against global carriers under international regulations. In May, Consumer Reports, non-profit federation U.S. PIRG and Denver resident and airline customer Jen Stansfield delivered to major airlines a petition signed by nearly 250,000 demanding cash refunds for canceled trips. In fact, the National Consumer League, which has welcomed the proposed refund legislation, objected in a May 28 statement to proposed rules from the DOT that it said ""require the agency to overcome burdensome hurdles before any new enforcement actions or consumer protection rule makings are initiated."" An airline is a ""negative-working-capital business"" that finances operations on proceeds from future sales, Mann explained. If carriers are forced to refund in cash those future sales, even fares understood to be nonrefundable when purchased, ""there is effectively no limit on the amount of cash draw on an airline's balance sheet,"" he said. ""It's been said that we should ignore or change the current law and regulations so that any canceled any passenger cancels is entitled to a refund,"" he testified. ""I'll just lay it out there for you right now: Revenue, negative revenue, exceeds bookings."" Forcing cash refunds in all instances would lead to airline bankruptcies ""very quickly,"" Calio said. According to Airlines for America, as of May 19, U.S. airlines were ""collectively burning"" as much as $7.5 billion per month, with net passenger bookings down 92% and booked revenue down 100% year over year. Unlimited passenger refunds would also mean much of the federal aid in grants and loans to airlines might ironically ""end up going right back to consumers in the form of refunds,"" Mann said. Airlines normally don't like to make refunds of any kind, mandatory or not. In March and April, the Transportation Department received more than 25,000 complaints from consumers who said they had been denied refunds by carriers, according to The Washington Post. Even in overseas markets like the European Union that have stronger air passenger protections in place, airlines are resisting pandemic-related refunds, said Nielsen at AirHelp. ""What we're seeing here in Europe is that airlines aren't paying because they're struggling financially and it just doesn't make any sense for them to pay,"" he said. ""They would rather face a lot of negative media, political pressure and all kinds of other pressure than pay out."""

Many have taken their frustrations to Twitter. Some hoped that artists would move to fully canceling tours to aid refunds, while others thought this should motivate artists to move their sales from Ticketmaster to other platforms.¬† Ticketmaster, however, is claiming that there has not actually been a change in their policy. The company gave statements to USA Today and the New York Times claiming their refund policy has remained consistent, and that this was simply a change in wording for clarity. ‚ÄúAs we receive updates from artists, teams and show organizers on their postponed and rescheduled events, as well as their individual refund policies, we will be providing fans with the latest news on their event status via this comprehensive information portal,‚Äù the company wrote.¬† ‚ÄúAs always, canceled events are automatically refunded,‚Äù the post continued. ‚ÄúIf an event organizer is offering refunds for postponed or rescheduled events, a refund link will appear on your Ticketmaster account. Otherwise, you are encouraged to periodically check back online to see if the status of their event has changed.‚Äù All of this was essentially to say that refunds could still be offered in the event of a postponed or rescheduled concert, but the responsibility lies with the event‚Äôs organizer, not Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster claims that this has always been the case, but fans were still irritated as the initial wording of their refund policy implied guaranteed refunds. Some have also had trouble getting money refunded to their accounts. One concert goer told the New York Times that of the many shows she had lined up this year that are no longer happening, but she has not seen the money for any.¬† Some artists have given fans varying information about what will happen to their tickets now that their concerts are put on hold. Former One Direction star Niall Horan, who canceled his 2020 tour, told his fans they will get full refunds, and to visit his website for more information. On the other hand, Justin Bieber, who postponed his tour, told fans to hang tight to their tickets while new dates are being settled.¬† Ticketmaster is not the only ticket vendor causing frustrations with their refund policy. The latest changes to StubHub‚Äôs refund policy have also raised eyebrows. If an event is postponed, tickets remain with the buyer until a new date has been selected. If it has been rescheduled, StubHub send the new details but if the buyer cannot make it, no refund will be given. SubHub users will be left to resell the ticket on the site.¬† If the event has been cancelled, StubHub will give the buyer a coupon worth 120% of the original order that can be used through the end of 2021 as a credit on their account. In no case was a full cash refund offered. As a result of this, StubHub is being sued, with some saying they should be legally obligated to give money back for canceled events. Some have also complained that refund credits have not made it to their accounts within the promised timeframes.¬† Of all of the companies to be dishonest during the pandemic, @StubHub is the most shocking to me.  Over 5 weeks since my event was canceled and still no refund, despite a promise to have my money back in 2-3 weeks."

Eventim sells tickets to concerts from the Red Hot Chili Peppers to Iron Maiden. Based on several refunds, reviewed by MarketWatch, for events in the U.K. in the coming months, Eventim would keep between 12%-14% of the price paid by consumers.  Ticket holders will lose out as the company says its ‚Äòprocessing and service‚Äô fees are nonrefundable, leading to accusations on social media that the company is profiteering from the crisis. Eventim confirmed customer refunds only included the face value of the ticket and not fees paid. It declined to comment when asked how much money it would retain from canceled events.  A spokesman for Eventim said: ‚ÄúIf the respective organizer has canceled the event and has commissioned us to reverse the ticket costs, we will immediately refund the ticket costs to the customer. The fees are for services already provided, such as shipping, packing, administration.‚Äù For one show at the Eventim Apollo theater, which seats 3,500, a customer was refunded ¬£11 less than they paid for each ticket, meaning Eventim could keep tens of thousands of pounds for an event that won‚Äôt happen.  LiveNation        LYV,         +0.22%      owned Ticketmaster, the biggest event ticketing company in the world, is offering full refunds to ticket holders for events canceled by coronavirus, including service fees, a spokesperson confirmed. Walker said he believes companies currently withholding full refunds will face a backlash from customers when they start buying tickets again. The Ticket Factory is another of Eventim‚Äôs competitors offering full refunds. It said: ‚ÄúTicket buyers are entitled to a full refund minus any postage costs where the tickets have already been posted.‚Äù He believes falling back on the often unread terms and conditions is unfair and many other ticket sellers are refunding customers the full amount paid. ‚ÄúSome booking fees can be up to 20%,‚Äù he said. Read:Airlines are issuing billions of dollars in vouchers ‚Äî but can you still get a cash refund for coronavirus-related flight cancellations? Thousands of events around the world have been canceled as social distancing rules prohibit large gatherings. Eventim‚Äôs terms and conditions read: ‚ÄúIf an event is postponed or canceled, you are entitled to a refund. This refund is for the face value of the tickets only and does not include the fees paid.‚Äù The German government on Friday announced legislation to allow refunds to be made as vouchers. The Eventim spokesman said the full amount paid for the ticket, including service fees, would be reflected in the voucher, customers will have until the end of 2021 to use the voucher, at which point they would be entitled to a full refund. ‚ÄúMany events have been cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak, however if a ticketing company is selling to UK customers it must comply with UK rules around refunds and cancellation, even if their parent company is not based in the UK,‚Äù he said."

After stating in a blog post that it is up to the discretion of event organizers to issue refunds for tickets to rescheduled events, the company lost the trust of many of its customers which may result in unintentional and negative consequences in the future. (Kanishka Mehra/Assistant Photo editor) Stimulus checks have begun to be given out, yet Ticketmaster refuses to refund its customers. To avoid the spread of COVID-19, concerts across the nation have been either canceled or postponed, leaving ticket holders in a state of limbo. Unsure of when the rescheduled dates will be, many are seeking refunds. In response, Ticketmaster ‚Äì one of the largest ticket sale and distribution companies ‚Äì quietly announced through a blog post that it won‚Äôt refund customers for postponed concert tickets. Instead, refunds are left to the discretion of each individual event organizer. Ticketmaster‚Äôs tone-deaf statement hides behind the facade that its new policy will protect the safety of fans. However, it only serves to benefit its own pocketbook. While canceled events are guaranteed to be refunded, Ticketmaster leaves refund policies for rescheduled and postponed concerts up to the discretion of event organizers ‚Äì a shifty option for a corporation that has contracts with venues as their exclusive ticket seller. Although venues have the option not to sell tickets through Ticketmaster, the company takes away logistical burdens as it handles all of the ticket distributions and operations. Although Ticketmaster may have altered its refund policy to maintain its company and the artists it supports, the announcement may have unintentional consequences in the future. Unfortunately, without any support from one of the largest ticket retailers, fans will likely be hesitant to buy concert tickets hereafter. And without fans to fill stadiums and theaters, the thousands of artists Ticketmaster supports through venue contracts may experience lower ticket sales. Simply, Ticketmaster needs to do better. COVID-19 has altered nearly all parts of life, and turning a blind eye and refusing to provide refunds for tickets at a time in which over 22 million Americans have filed for unemployment is nothing short of greedy. The company must begin supporting and relieving its customers, starting with rightfully refunding tickets."

Events and concerts are continuing to get canceled, so if you had plans for an outdoor festival or Broadway play this summer, make sure to check your ticketing company for information about refunds and ticket credits. Since we last reported on how to get your money back, several ticketing sites have updated their terms and conditions, so we‚Äôve updated this post with the latest information. Here are what the top ones have to say. Live Nation created the Ticket Refund Plan amid coronavirus cancellations. If your event was canceled, you will be automatically refunded, or if your event was scheduled for a Live Nation venue, you have 30 days to ask for a 150 percent credit to use toward buying future tickets. If your event has been postponed, tickets will be valid for the new date. If you want a refund, you have 30 days to request it starting from the announcement of the new show date. ‚ÄúIf you have tickets to a show that is postponed, you will be able to select your refund option once the new date is announced,‚Äù Live Nation‚Äôs website reads. ‚ÄúIf 60 days has passed since a show was postponed and no rescheduled dates have been announced, the 30-day window for refunds will open at that time.‚Äù In a memo leaked to Variety, Michael Rapino, chairman and CEO, told staff that Live Nation has refunded more than $80 million to ticket holders with more than 8,000 concerts and events impacted since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. If your event was canceled, Ticketmaster will issue you a full refund, according to its website. If your event was rescheduled, Ticketmaster will contact you as soon as they know the new date. Sometimes the event organizer will offer a refund for a rescheduled date, and if that‚Äôs the case for your event, that link will be visible in your Ticketmaster account online. If your event was postponed or rescheduled and you can‚Äôt attend the new date, you can sell your tickets to another buyer through Ticketmaster. In the same memo, Rapino writes to his staff, ‚ÄúIt is important to remind everyone that Ticketmaster is a platform, and does not hold on to money from client sales. In order to issue refunds, Ticketmaster must first get approval and funds from our clients. These event organizers of concerts, festivals, games or events set the policy on refunds, and Ticketmaster facilitates services accordingly.‚Äù According to the memo, Ticketmaster has already refunded $400 million in sales to ticketholders. If your event is canceled, you are protected through its SeatGeek‚Äôs Buyer Guarantee, which states ‚Äúyou will be refunded the full purchase price or issued a credit to be used for a future purchase to be determined in SeatGeek‚Äôs sole discretion,‚Äù according to SeatGeek‚Äôs website. If the event is postponed, your tickets will likely be good for the new date (depending on the venue‚Äôs policies). Because the beginning of the MLB season has been postponed, SeatGeek will refund canceled spring-training tickets. If your event has been postponed, you have 30 days from when the rescheduled date is announced to request a refund from AEG Presents. If a rescheduled date has already been announced, you will receive an email in May with instructions on how to request a refund. ‚ÄúTickets purchased AFTER the rescheduled date has been announced will not be eligible for this refund,‚Äù AEG Presents‚Äô website reads. ‚ÄúIf your show hasn‚Äôt announced a new date yet, please hold on to your tickets. You will be receiving an email notification from the ticketing company when the show is rescheduled, along with information on how to request a refund should you choose not to attend the rescheduled event. Note that if you wish to attend the rescheduled show, your original tickets will remain valid for the new date.‚Äù Broadway shows have been suspended until June 7, according to the Broadway League. ‚ÄúThose holding tickets for performances through June 7, 2020 will receive an email from their point of purchase with information regarding exchanges or refunds,‚Äù the Broadway League‚Äôs website reads. ‚ÄúAny customers holding tickets through June 7, 2020 that have not received an email by April 12 should reach out to their point of purchase for information regarding exchanges or refunds.‚Äù If you purchased your ticket from Telecharge and the event has been suspended or canceled, Telecharge will email you with instructions on how to exchange or refund your tickets, according to its website. ‚ÄúThere is no need to contact us right now,‚Äù the website reads. Cinemark probably won‚Äôt reopen until July, according to the L.A. Times. If you have Cinemark Movie Rewards points, those will be extended to June 30, according to its website, and its Movie Club membership will pause payments while the theaters are closed. Any tickets purchased in advanced will be refunded. After SXSW was canceled this year, a blog posted on its site on March 12 says that ticket holder‚Äôs 2020 ticket to the festival could be used in 2021, 2022, or 2023, and ‚Äú50 percent off the walk-up rate in an alternate year of your choosing between 2021 and 2023.‚Äù This didn‚Äôt sit well with some ticket holders. On April 24, Maria Bromley and Kleber Pauta filed a lawsuit against SXSW claiming to have spent more than $1,000 each on attending the event. Not only would SXSW not offer a refund, the offer to use tickets for another year would expire April 30. ‚ÄúSXSW has, in effect, shifted the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic onto festivalgoers ‚Ä¶ individuals who in these desperate times may sorely need the money they paid to SXSW for a festival that never occurred,‚Äù the complaint reads, according to Billboard. ‚ÄúDue to the unique nature of SXSW‚Äôs business, where we are reliant on one annual event, we incurred extensive amounts of non-recoupable costs well in advance of March. These expenditures, and the loss of expected revenue, have resulted in a situation where we do not have the money to issue refunds,‚Äù SXSW‚Äôs statement to Billboard says. ‚ÄúSXSW, like many small businesses across the country, is in a dire financial situation requiring that we rely on our contracts, which have a clearly stated no refunds policy. Though we wish we were able to do more, we are doing our best to reconcile the situation and offered a deferral package option to purchasers of 2020 registrations.‚Äù If you had Coachella tickets for the spring, you can get a refund until June 1, according to its website. However, if you can and want to attend the fall Coachella weekends on October 9‚Äì11 and October 16‚Äì18, your spring tickets are good for the fall. If you want a refund, you can request it through your Burner Profile, according to the website, but Burning Man is urging ticket holders to donate to Burning Man Project to help keep staff and the Burning Man vision alive. Newport Folk Festival has been canceled, but you have three options for what to do with your ticket, according to its website. ‚ÄúDonate all or a portion of your ticket that will go directly towards ensuring our festival for 2021 while continuing our support for artists and educators; apply your refund towards a 2021 Revival Membership ‚Äî a new and onetime offer we‚Äôve created specifically to ensure our future and provide these members with 3-day tickets to the 2021 festival (remaining memberships will be offered to the general public directly after the request period); or receive a 100 percent full refund if desired.‚Äù Glastonbury has also been canceled. If you do nothing, your $62 deposit will roll over to next year‚Äôs festival, which ensures you‚Äôll have a chance to buy a ticket for next year. According to this tweet, if you want a refund check your email for ‚Äúofficial information.‚Äù If you planned on traveling for a festival or concert this year, then you‚Äôll most likely need to cancel your Airbnb. If you booked an Airbnb on or before March 14, you will get your money back if your check-in date is between March 14 and May 31, according to Airbnb‚Äôs website. You can choose between a travel credit or full cash refund. If your check-in date is after May 31, you are not covered under COVID-19-related extenuating circumstances. The host‚Äôs cancellation policy will apply as usual. If you made a reservation after March 14, you are not covered under COVID-19-related circumstances unless the guest or host is sick with COVID-19. Disneyland has the same policy ‚Äî if you have a ‚Äúpassport‚Äù to Disneyland and you‚Äôve paid in full, the expiration date will be extended, according to its website. Also, if you‚Äôve paid in full, you can request a partial refund by calling 714-781-4567. If you‚Äôre on a monthly payment plan, payments will be stopped while the park is closed."

For anyone who purchased a ticket through a ticket-reselling website, refunds will depend on the site's terms and conditions. Some sites, like Viagogo, have already said customers will get a full refund in the event of a cancellation. If an event is moved and you cannot make the rearranged date, you should be entitled to your money back. For example, European football's governing body, Uefa, says it will refund all Euro 2020 ticket holders who can't make any rearranged dates in 2021. Organisers of the Glastonbury Festival say that anyone that has paid a ¬£50 deposit can roll it over to next year in order to buy a ticket for the 2021 event. Otherwise, people can ask for their ¬£50 to be refunded. If you are taking part in something, the same refund rules may apply to entry fees if it is cancelled. But you need to check the event organiser's terms and conditions.  If you have heard nothing about a refund after a couple of weeks, follow it up, says consumer rights journalist Helen Dewdney. Using a credit card to buy something costing between ¬£100 and ¬£30,000 means you are legally entitled to a refund if you do not get what you were promised. Even if the ticket is worth less than ¬£100, or a debit card was used instead, there is still the chance of getting a refund under the chargeback scheme. This is used to reverse the transaction. Many events are put on to raise money for good causes. Many art, music and theatre groups are charities and rely heavily on ticket sales for income. They say there could be serious financial implications if they have to refund all tickets. Some, including the BFI (British Film Institute), have asked ticket holders to consider not asking for a refund so that the money can be used as a charitable donation instead. ""But if it's a festival with multiple acts, that means you have a ticket for the festival and not the individual performer. In that instance, you can't expect a refund."""

Understandably, people have questions. Can I get a refund for my canceled concert?¬†AEG is automatically refunding patrons for canceled concerts ‚Äî meaning that concertgoers won‚Äôt have to do anything other than wait for their money to reappear. If the show you were planning to attend was being put on by Live Nation, you still have to request a refund ‚Äî yes, even if it was canceled. According to a statement acquired by Rolling Stone, Live Nation is offering full refunds, but their venues are also offering credit for future ticket purchases through a new program called Rock When You‚Äôre Ready. In this scenario ‚Äî assuming a fan doesn‚Äôt want a refund and still plans on putting that money toward a concert ‚Äî once the bans on mass gatherings are lifted, patrons will be able to receive up to 150 percent of their ticket value in ‚Äúconcert cash‚Äù (So, if fans spent $200 on tickets, they would receive $300 in credit.) On the other hand, if they would rather take a charitable route, patrons can donate their tickets via Live Nation‚Äôs Hero Nation program. These options become available on May 1st. At that point, patrons have 30 days following cancelation to select their choice. As of now, it‚Äôs not clear how long the refunds will take to be fully processed by either Live Nation or AEG. On the AEG-owned AXS‚Äô website, though, a Help Center page states that ‚Äúif your event is cancelled, we‚Äôll automatically refund the credit card used for purchase (usually within 30 business days of the cancellation announcement).‚Äù The page reminds patrons who bought their tickets at the venue‚Äôs box office to ‚Äúplease take the tickets directly to the box office for a refund.‚Äù Can I get a refund for my postponed concert?¬†¬†Also starting May 1st, AEG will give patrons 30 days to request a full refund to shows that have already been rescheduled with solidified dates. Tickets for shows that have been postponed ‚Äî but do not yet have publicly confirmed replacement dates ‚Äî will not be eligible for refunds until new dates are announced. ‚ÄúFor shows that have already announced a rescheduled date, you will receive an email from the ticketing company starting on May 1st with instructions on how to refund your tickets,‚Äù reads a statement acquired by Rolling Stone. ‚ÄúYou will have 30 days from the time the email is sent to you to request your refund. Tickets purchased after the rescheduled date has been announced will not be eligible for this refund.‚Ä¶ If your show hasn‚Äôt announced a new date yet, please hold on to your tickets. You will be receiving an email notification from the ticketing company when the show is rescheduled, along with information on how to request a refund should you choose not to attend the rescheduled event. Note that if you wish to attend the rescheduled show, your original tickets will remain valid for the new date.‚Äù Patrons of Live Nation have the same 30-day window of time to request a full refund to rescheduled shows that have new dates. However, Live Nation is also presenting people in this scenario the opportunity to use their Rock When You‚Äôre Ready program‚Äôs ‚Äúconcert cash‚Äù credit. So, patrons can either get a refund for a rescheduled show, simply use their original ticket to attend a rescheduled show, or they can turn the price of that ticket into credit to be used toward any future ticket purchases at any Live Nation venue in the U.S. and Canada. A Live Nation representative also told Rolling Stone, ‚ÄúIf a show is rescheduled and a fan attends the new date, [the company will] give them $15 or $20 (depending on venue) in Live Nation Concert Cash for every ticket used.

While cancellations generally receive automatic refunds, postponed or rescheduled shows - a category the large majority of 2020 concerts would currently fall under - wade into a gray area that is often handled on a case-by-case basis. ‚ÄúIn the past, with a routine volume of event interruptions, we and our event organizers have been able to consistently offer more flexibility with refunds for postponed and rescheduled events,‚Äù Ticketmaster said in a statement. ‚ÄúHowever, considering the currently unprecedented volume of affected events, we are focused on supporting organizers as they work to determine venue availability, new dates and refund policies, while rescheduling thousands of events in what continues to be an evolving situation.‚Äù Meanwhile, StubHub insists ‚Äúit is currently impossible for us to offer immediate cash refunds to all buyers.‚Äù The ticketing giant is instead offering a coupon for fans to use toward a future purchase, valued at 120 percent of the original purchase. These numbers, of course, are of little concern to individual concertgoers who are much more focused on their own outlays. A ticket buyer in Wisconsin has already filed a class-action lawsuit against StubHub, claiming that the company's financial constraints ""are entirely of its own making"" and that altering¬†its refund policy from cash to coupons is ""cruel and wrong."" Meanwhile, many fans admit they are unlikely to return to live shows even once social-distancing bans are lifted."

This situation is unfounded in our time and to act hastily or irresponsibly now could have very serious repercussions on the mothers of our children or children.

Joe x  We are very sorry to announce that we are no longer able to move forward with our South American and US tours planned in March & April.  With the postponement of both Lollapalooza and Coachella, we have considered all options to perform our own shows in these cities & still reach our fans, but with local advisories & restrictions in response to COVID-19, it is just not possible. Bans on some international travel have made it impossible for some members of our band & crew to travel to these countries. With these things so constantly changing, we cannot risk not being able to be at home to support and look after the more vulnerable members of our communities and families. With these tours no longer being possible, we have absorbed a huge financial loss, and it has left us in a very challenging position, but we will be around to fight another day. For this, we feel very fortunate.  Our thoughts go out to everyone else who have found themselves in the position of lost work & income over the next few months, including all the hard-working touring crew and artists across the live industry. Also, our thoughts are with the venues, the independent companies, cafes, restaurants, record stores ‚Äì the list is endless. We encourage everyone to support each other, so we can weather this storm.  With regards to the Mexico tour, this is being assessed on a daily basis. If there is any way we can do shows, safely & responsibly, we always will. Individual festivals and shows will have specifics on any rescheduled or cancelled dates and information on refunds and tickets. Huge love and respect goes out to all the support and medical staff in our NHS and emergency services all around the world.

Steve Currall, the USF president, said in an interview this week that the decision to not offer refunds was based on what the university could afford. In addition to the new refund policy, the addendum outlines changes in the residential experience and expectations of students, including wearing masks when within six feet of another student and not allowing visitors. USF spokesman Adam Freeman said the university‚Äôs reopening plan is centered around risk mitigation, with the hope that the semester continues without interruption to other student services. But USF does not plan to refund housing costs, or other student fees. ‚ÄúWe have to prepare for a range of possible scenarios and develop contingency plans if we have to scale back operations due to COVID-19,‚Äù he said in an email. ‚ÄúOur contingency plans give us the flexibility to allow our students to continue taking courses and accessing services remotely to keep them on a path to timely graduation without providing refunds.‚Äù When the pandemic caused courses to shift online in spring, universities across the state partially refunded housing and dining plans. But they did not do the same for parking, transportation and other fees. A lawsuit filed by a University of Florida student in May against the state university system called for these fees to be refunded. Matthew Miller, an attorney for the case, said the state university system has yet to respond to the complaint. No decisions have been made about housing refunds at the University of Florida and the University of Central Florida, according to officials in public information offices at those schools. Sofia Gluskin, who will be a sophomore in fall, said she read the addendum quickly and didn‚Äôt grasp the part about no refunds until she saw a post in a Facebook group. ‚ÄúI feel that if USF feels they can even open their dorms, they should be willing to refund us if they have to be closed again, as that would still be out of our control,‚Äù she said."

Jeni Garcia is one of the lucky ones. She had tickets to a Keane show on March 15 in Austin, Texas, that were automatically refunded when the show was canceled. Her tickets to a Glass Animals show in San Antonio, though, haven't been refunded because the concert is¬†classified as postponed. In response to the criticism, Ticketmaster's parent company, Live Nation, announced an initiative¬†Friday that will give ticketholders 30 days to request a refund once their postponed show sets a new date. If they don't want a refund, their tickets will still be good for the rescheduled show.¬† Live Nation's rival AEG Presents announced a similar 30-day refund program last week, also starting May 1.¬† Eventbrite, another major ticket seller, suggests contacting event organizers directly for details on potential refunds for postponed shows and events. Organizers are expected to reply to inquiries within a week, according to Eventbrite's site. ¬† Bonnaroo, on its website, says refunds are available ""in the event of a full cancellation,"" but the Tennessee music and arts festival wasn't canceled. Instead, it was pushed from June to September.¬† A lot of money is on the line for performers, promoters and venues, which could explain why refunds are hard to get. With concerts expected to be delayed or canceled into the summer, the industry is looking¬†at a minimum projected loss of $10 billion, according to Dave Brooks, Billboard's senior director of live and touring. If the shutdown extends into 2021, it would be even more catastrophic. ""We all talked about whether or not we should get the tickets refunded or wait it out,"" she says. ""We came to the same agreement: Let‚Äôs just get (a refund)."" Their hopes of a refund quickly vanished, though, after several back-and-forths with Ticketmaster representatives, she says. But Radcliffe suspects it may get bumped back again. He and his wife haven't requested a refund ‚Äì yet ‚Äì saying they're ""waiting things out to a degree."" If you paid with a credit card and a refund isn't being offered by your ticket seller, you could try to have your bank initiate a chargeback, says Billboard's Brooks.

When Lisa DeWitt reached out about a refund, she was told no refunds would be offered ‚Äî her tickets would instead be good for the 2021 festival. That original Facebook statement, which she‚Äôd screenshotted, was gone within 24 hours. ‚ÄúThese ‚Äòno refund‚Äô policies, when the event is rescheduled, are clearly noted on our ‚ÄòTicket Information‚Äô language on our website and was a condition of every online sale through Etix,‚Äù the festival‚Äôs website now states. With tens of thousands of concerts, festivals and sporting events shut down from March through the foreseeable future, many consumers are getting antsy about whether they can get refunds for their tickets. On April 17, Ticketmaster President Jarred Smith tweeted that the company does not ‚Äúintend to withhold refunds on postponed shows.‚Äù That has not stopped New York state officials from launching an investigation into whether the company subtly changed its refund policy in the wake of COVID-19. (The company has said it was a clarification, not a change.) And it has not stopped two members of Congress, Democrats Katie Porter and Bill Pascrell Jr., from calling upon Ticketmaster to refund everything. According to Variety, two major promoters, Live Nation and AEG, have initiated a refund program that will kick into place May 1. If a concert is canceled, fans will either be automatically refunded, or in some cases must request a refund. If, however, a concert is postponed to a new date, ticketholders will have 30 days from that point to request a refund through Live Nation-owned sites (like Ticketmaster) or AEG-owned sites (like AXS). Ticketmaster has also said it will waive its seller fees for resale postings created through May 31. In an email, Tampa Bay Blues Festival president Charles Ross said the festival initially tried to refund buyers who couldn‚Äôt attend the rescheduled festival ‚Äúfor serious reasons like medical events, family commitments, etc.,"" but it became ‚Äútoo complicated to interface with the buyers, so we chose to follow our published procedures.‚Äù They did change their policies to allow ticketholders to resell passes to a third party. It doesn‚Äôt feel that way to DeWitt, who has started a private Facebook group, ‚ÄúTBBF We Want Our Refund,‚Äù for ticketholders to vent about the festival‚Äôs refund policy. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what next April is going to bring, and whether or not I can travel from Colorado,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI understand their plight, but they also publicize that they sell out their VIP tickets every year. So why can‚Äôt they just refund our money, like they said they were going to, and sell to someone else?‚Äù In general, tickets purchased for an event that‚Äôs been canceled can be refunded. For most online purchases, that will happen automatically, but it‚Äôs good to confirm that through the retailer or venue. Most tickets to postponed events will be honored on the new date. One caveat: Many organizations have closed or changed their box office hours; those that are open may be dealing with high call volume. And some venues require you to wait until a new date has been announced before inquiring about a refund. So if you can‚Äôt get answers immediately, be patient. Here‚Äôs how some Tampa Bay venues and entities are handling ticket refunds. If there‚Äôs an organization not on this list, and you want to know whether you can get a refund, contact us here, and we‚Äôll try to add it. Amalie Arena: It‚Äôs a confusing time to be a ticketholder at Amalie Arena, between events being postponed, moved, canceled ‚Äî and then there‚Äôs the Lightning, who have their own ticket refund policy. The arena has outlined what‚Äôs going on with each of its events here. Florida Orchestra: The orchestra, like other nonprofits, is encouraging people to consider donating the cost of their ticket, or exchange it for credit for a future performance. But those specifically requesting refunds can get them by contacting (727) 892-3337 or ticketcenter@floridaorchestra.org. The Palladium: The St. Petersburg theater, like a lot of venues, is asking patrons to consider keeping their tickets, exchanging them for credit or donating the cost to its programs. But it is also allowing ticketholders to request refunds. Click here for details. Raymond James Stadium: Refunds are already available for the Sunset Music Festival (see below) and Tampa Bay Vipers. Refunds will be available for Kenny Chesney, once a new date is announced. The Rolling Stones, who have pushed back their July 5 show, have not yet announced whether refunds are available. Click here. David A. Straz Jr. Center for the Performing Arts: The Straz Center has always offered ticket refunds for canceled or postponed events, and is keeping that policy during the pandemic. Ticketholders may also choose to donate the value of their ticket to benefit an organization like Opera Tampa or the Patel Conservatory, or receive credit for a future show. Contact comments@strazcenter for more options. Click here for details. Tampa Theatre: At the moment, ticketholders may receive refunds for events that have been canceled. For events that have been postponed, they must wait for the new date before contacting the box office about refund options. In the meantime, contact gargoyles@tampatheatre.org for information.

Reggae Rise Up: Upon postponing their event from March until Oct. 2-4, the St. Petersburg reggae-rock festival announced there would be no refunds (which is in keeping with their normal rain-or-shine ticket policy).

Most venues, major ticket sellers and resellers are offering refunds. If you bought your tickets online, most refunds will be automatically processed to your original form of payment. How long the refund takes varies from company to company. But, says¬†Ted Rossman, an industry analyst for CreditCards.com, we are in¬†""uncharted territory.""¬†Never before have we seen such a massive volume of cancellations and, with swift-moving developments, not all decisions on whether and how to issue refunds have been made yet.¬† If you are looking for a refund, start with the ticket seller, he advises. For example, trade group Broadway League¬†says ticket holders for performances through April 12 should contact ‚Äútheir point of purchase‚Äù for refunds and exchanges. If you can't get anywhere, try your credit card company. That added¬†buyer protection is why he recommends using a credit card over a debit card or cash for tickets. Some credit cards have better track records of doling out¬†refunds than others, Rossman said.¬† In some cases, refund information has not yet been announced. Be patient. ‚Ä¢ Ticketmaster:¬†Ticketmaster has a list of events that have been canceled or postponed. If you purchased tickets from Ticketmaster for an event that was canceled, you will automatically receive a refund to the same card you bought them with, minus UPS fees, within seven to 10 business days, according to the company. You can also sign into your Ticketmaster account, select your order, select refund and choose the tickets you‚Äôd like refunded.¬† If an event was postponed, Ticketmaster will contact you by phone or email with the new event information as soon as it has it. If you can‚Äôt make the new date, you will see a refund button in your order if refunds are approved ‚Äúby the artist, team, venue, or promoter.‚Äù More information¬†here.¬† ‚Ä¢ Telecharge.com:¬†Telecharge.com¬†says ticket holders for Broadway or New World Stages performances between March 12 and April 12 will automatically be refunded to credit cards. ‚Ä¢ StubHub: The ticket reseller¬†said it will provide full refunds, including fees, for canceled events. Or, StubHub customers¬†can choose to get a coupon worth 120%¬†of the original purchase toward a future event. ‚Ä¢ SeatGeek:¬†If an event is canceled, ticket holders will be refunded to their original payment method within three weeks, the company says. If an event is postponed, tickets will most likely be valid for the new date, but that will depend on the venue‚Äôs policy. Ticket holders will receive updates by email. ‚ÄúIn general if the event is canceled the buyer will receive a 100% refund,‚Äù spokesman Chris Leyden said. More information here. ‚Ä¢ Vivid Seats:¬†If an event is canceled¬†and not rescheduled, Vivid Seats¬†says customers will get a full refund including delivery charges through its 100% Buyer Guarantee. But as part of the COVID-19 policy, if an event is canceled, you also have the option of a 120% store credit. For postponed events,¬†the purchase will probably be valid for the new date, though every event may be different, the company said.

If games are not played or played in an empty arena, fans can get a refund or receive a credit for a future game.¬† The Boston Red Sox said¬†season-ticket holders would be issued a credit for games that are not played. Individual spring training tickets purchased directly through the club will be eligible for full refunds, the team said. The Baltimore Orioles issued a statement saying:¬†‚ÄúWe will communicate additional details, including information about refunds, directly to fans when they become available, as this is a rapidly evolving situation.‚Äù If you¬†ordered¬†tickets from an official NCAA Championship vendor, you will receive additional information¬†via¬†email and you will automatically receive a refund, minus fees, to the original method of payment.

Events and concerts are continuing to get canceled, so if you had plans for an outdoor festival or Broadway play this summer, make sure to check your ticketing company for information about refunds and ticket credits. Since we last reported on how to get your money back, several ticketing sites have updated their terms and conditions, so we‚Äôve updated this post with the latest information. Here are what the top ones have to say. Live Nation created the Ticket Refund Plan amid coronavirus cancellations. If your event was canceled, you will be automatically refunded, or if your event was scheduled for a Live Nation venue, you have 30 days to ask for a 150 percent credit to use toward buying future tickets. If your event has been postponed, tickets will be valid for the new date. If you want a refund, you have 30 days to request it starting from the announcement of the new show date. ‚ÄúIf you have tickets to a show that is postponed, you will be able to select your refund option once the new date is announced,‚Äù Live Nation‚Äôs website reads. ‚ÄúIf 60 days has passed since a show was postponed and no rescheduled dates have been announced, the 30-day window for refunds will open at that time.‚Äù In a memo leaked to Variety, Michael Rapino, chairman and CEO, told staff that Live Nation has refunded more than $80 million to ticket holders with more than 8,000 concerts and events impacted since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. If your event was canceled, Ticketmaster will issue you a full refund, according to its website. If your event was rescheduled, Ticketmaster will contact you as soon as they know the new date. Sometimes the event organizer will offer a refund for a rescheduled date, and if that‚Äôs the case for your event, that link will be visible in your Ticketmaster account online. If your event was postponed or rescheduled and you can‚Äôt attend the new date, you can sell your tickets to another buyer through Ticketmaster. In the same memo, Rapino writes to his staff, ‚ÄúIt is important to remind everyone that Ticketmaster is a platform, and does not hold on to money from client sales. In order to issue refunds, Ticketmaster must first get approval and funds from our clients. These event organizers of concerts, festivals, games or events set the policy on refunds, and Ticketmaster facilitates services accordingly.‚Äù According to the memo, Ticketmaster has already refunded $400 million in sales to ticketholders. If your event is canceled, you are protected through its SeatGeek‚Äôs Buyer Guarantee, which states ‚Äúyou will be refunded the full purchase price or issued a credit to be used for a future purchase to be determined in SeatGeek‚Äôs sole discretion,‚Äù according to SeatGeek‚Äôs website. If the event is postponed, your tickets will likely be good for the new date (depending on the venue‚Äôs policies). Because the beginning of the MLB season has been postponed, SeatGeek will refund canceled spring-training tickets. If your event has been postponed, you have 30 days from when the rescheduled date is announced to request a refund from AEG Presents. If a rescheduled date has already been announced, you will receive an email in May with instructions on how to request a refund. ‚ÄúTickets purchased AFTER the rescheduled date has been announced will not be eligible for this refund,‚Äù AEG Presents‚Äô website reads. ‚ÄúIf your show hasn‚Äôt announced a new date yet, please hold on to your tickets. You will be receiving an email notification from the ticketing company when the show is rescheduled, along with information on how to request a refund should you choose not to attend the rescheduled event. Note that if you wish to attend the rescheduled show, your original tickets will remain valid for the new date.‚Äù Broadway shows have been suspended until June 7, according to the Broadway League. ‚ÄúThose holding tickets for performances through June 7, 2020 will receive an email from their point of purchase with information regarding exchanges or refunds,‚Äù the Broadway League‚Äôs website reads. ‚ÄúAny customers holding tickets through June 7, 2020 that have not received an email by April 12 should reach out to their point of purchase for information regarding exchanges or refunds.‚Äù If you purchased your ticket from Telecharge and the event has been suspended or canceled, Telecharge will email you with instructions on how to exchange or refund your tickets, according to its website. ‚ÄúThere is no need to contact us right now,‚Äù the website reads. Cinemark probably won‚Äôt reopen until July, according to the L.A. Times. If you have Cinemark Movie Rewards points, those will be extended to June 30, according to its website, and its Movie Club membership will pause payments while the theaters are closed. Any tickets purchased in advanced will be refunded. After SXSW was canceled this year, a blog posted on its site on March 12 says that ticket holder‚Äôs 2020 ticket to the festival could be used in 2021, 2022, or 2023, and ‚Äú50 percent off the walk-up rate in an alternate year of your choosing between 2021 and 2023.‚Äù This didn‚Äôt sit well with some ticket holders. On April 24, Maria Bromley and Kleber Pauta filed a lawsuit against SXSW claiming to have spent more than $1,000 each on attending the event. Not only would SXSW not offer a refund, the offer to use tickets for another year would expire April 30. ‚ÄúSXSW has, in effect, shifted the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic onto festivalgoers ‚Ä¶ individuals who in these desperate times may sorely need the money they paid to SXSW for a festival that never occurred,‚Äù the complaint reads, according to Billboard. ‚ÄúDue to the unique nature of SXSW‚Äôs business, where we are reliant on one annual event, we incurred extensive amounts of non-recoupable costs well in advance of March. These expenditures, and the loss of expected revenue, have resulted in a situation where we do not have the money to issue refunds,‚Äù SXSW‚Äôs statement to Billboard says. ‚ÄúSXSW, like many small businesses across the country, is in a dire financial situation requiring that we rely on our contracts, which have a clearly stated no refunds policy. Though we wish we were able to do more, we are doing our best to reconcile the situation and offered a deferral package option to purchasers of 2020 registrations.‚Äù If you had Coachella tickets for the spring, you can get a refund until June 1, according to its website. However, if you can and want to attend the fall Coachella weekends on October 9‚Äì11 and October 16‚Äì18, your spring tickets are good for the fall. If you want a refund, you can request it through your Burner Profile, according to the website, but Burning Man is urging ticket holders to donate to Burning Man Project to help keep staff and the Burning Man vision alive. Newport Folk Festival has been canceled, but you have three options for what to do with your ticket, according to its website. ‚ÄúDonate all or a portion of your ticket that will go directly towards ensuring our festival for 2021 while continuing our support for artists and educators; apply your refund towards a 2021 Revival Membership ‚Äî a new and onetime offer we‚Äôve created specifically to ensure our future and provide these members with 3-day tickets to the 2021 festival (remaining memberships will be offered to the general public directly after the request period); or receive a 100 percent full refund if desired.‚Äù Glastonbury has also been canceled. If you do nothing, your $62 deposit will roll over to next year‚Äôs festival, which ensures you‚Äôll have a chance to buy a ticket for next year. According to this tweet, if you want a refund check your email for ‚Äúofficial information.‚Äù If you planned on traveling for a festival or concert this year, then you‚Äôll most likely need to cancel your Airbnb. If you booked an Airbnb on or before March 14, you will get your money back if your check-in date is between March 14 and May 31, according to Airbnb‚Äôs website. You can choose between a travel credit or full cash refund. If your check-in date is after May 31, you are not covered under COVID-19-related extenuating circumstances. The host‚Äôs cancellation policy will apply as usual. If you made a reservation after March 14, you are not covered under COVID-19-related circumstances unless the guest or host is sick with COVID-19. Disneyland has the same policy ‚Äî if you have a ‚Äúpassport‚Äù to Disneyland and you‚Äôve paid in full, the expiration date will be extended, according to its website. Also, if you‚Äôve paid in full, you can request a partial refund by calling 714-781-4567. If you‚Äôre on a monthly payment plan, payments will be stopped while the park is closed."

They‚Äôve spent countless hours on hold, ping-ponged between travel providers passing the buck and struggled to make sense of companies‚Äô shape-shifting refund policies.  ‚ÄúEvery stakeholder in travel is frustrated,‚Äù said Kurt Ebenhoch, executive director of Travel Fairness Now, a consumer advocacy group based in suburban Lake Villa. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never been this kind of volume of refund activity. It‚Äôs a confusing, difficult time for consumers, especially when the rules aren‚Äôt being adhered to.‚Äù  There‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all solution for getting cash back on travel plans derailed by the health crisis. Some people, try as they might, will simply be out of luck depending on the fine print of their contracts, among other variables. But for many consumers, there are ways to bolster the chances of a refund. Here are some tips and advice on how to do that.  When an airline nixes a flight or makes a significant schedule change, the U.S. Department of Transportation says consumers are entitled to their money back, even on cheaper, nonrefundable tickets.  Multiple carriers changed their policies during the pandemic to make refunds more restrictive and leave people with seemingly little choice other than to accept a voucher for future travel. The nonprofit group has a hotline, 877-FLYERS6, to help people navigate these sticky situations.   The air travel assistance company Cranky Concierge recently launched a new offering called Refund Hunter to help airline customers figure out their options for postponing or getting a refund on a particular flight. Once the customer decides what to do, the company tells them how to handle that request with their airline or travel agent.   Consumer advocates recommend filing complaints online with the U.S. Department of Transportation to pressure the agency to hold airlines accountable for refunds.   For refund gripes not related to airlines, consumers can file online complaints with the Illinois Attorney General‚Äôs Office.  Under DOT rules, customers with nonrefundable tickets who choose not to travel during the pandemic aren‚Äôt eligible for cash refunds. This rankles a lot of people who feel they‚Äôre being penalized for following health orders to avoid nonessential travel to stop the spread of COVID-19.  The fight over coronavirus-related airline refunds has already moved into the courthouse.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the nuclear option, and I think we‚Äôre there,‚Äù said William McGee, who works in the advocacy division of Consumer Reports. The nonprofit group‚Äôs website started soliciting people‚Äôs airline refund stories last week and already has more than 1,800 entries. ‚ÄúConsumer anger is at an all-time high.‚Äù  Proposed class action lawsuits over denied refunds have been filed in federal court against several airlines, including United, Southwest and Spirit.   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see a lot more cases,‚Äù said Sweetnam, who recently filed one in Chicago against low-cost carrier Volaris. The lawsuit alleges the Mexico-based airline refused his client, Gold Coast resident Samantha Levey, a full refund for her flight the airline canceled in March.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre asking that money be returned to not only Samantha but also to (refund) other class members,‚Äù Sweetnam said. ‚ÄúI imagine you‚Äôre talking about several thousand, if not tens of thousands, of affected consumers.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWait and let the airline cancel first,‚Äù said Ebenhoch of Travel Fairness Now. ‚ÄúThat puts you in a much better position for a refund.‚Äù  The home-sharing and rental site Airbnb initially offered full refunds on reservations with check-in dates between March 14 and April 14. It later extended the window for COVID-19-related refunds to May 31. The refund offer isn‚Äôt retroactive, so guests with trips in late April or May who canceled before Airbnb extended the deadline aren‚Äôt covered by the updated policy.  One of Airbnb‚Äôs competitors, Vrbo, has taken a lot of heat over the way it‚Äôs handled refunds during the coronavirus crisis. The company has essentially left it up to guests and hosts to hash it out. That meant Aurora resident Drew Nicholson was on the hook for about $2,500 for a couple of homes he rented in Brownsburg, Indiana, to house 36 people in late March, when both states were under stay-at-home orders. Nicholson wants his money back but the host refuses, offering a credit instead.   Vacation packages, flights and hotels booked through Expedia, Orbitz and other online travel agencies have added an extra layer of hassle for many refund seekers, particularly with airline tickets.   Orbitz emailed the Rogers Park photographer saying there was no need to call, he‚Äôd been issued flight credits. But Harris did call, several times, because he didn‚Äôt want credits. He wanted a refund. Because his now-canceled flights were more than 72 hours away, he kept getting disconnected after entering his reservation number.  ‚ÄúI know people want to rage on them, but I just stayed nice and explained that I‚Äôm not working right now and these refunds are like relief checks for me,‚Äù said Harris, who was on the phone with Orbitz for nearly three hours. ‚ÄúI quoted some language from the DOT guidelines about being owed a refund and I think that might have tipped the scale. He put me on hold again and came back and said United is offering the refund.‚Äù  Orbitz spokeswoman Mel Dohmen said companies like Orbitz, which is owned by Expedia Group, generally follow the refund and cancellation policies of their travel partners ‚Äî in this case, the airlines.   She added that many international carriers have blocked online travel agencies from processing refunds in an automated way, ‚Äúwhich adds complexity for our agents and clearly presents a blocker to providing the level of service we would like to help our customers in a timely fashion.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf you want a refund,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to say you‚Äôre probably going to have to work for it.‚Äù"

Starting May 1, once postponed shows set new dates, fans will begin receiving emails from Ticketmaster to initiate a full refund. Fans will then have 30 days to request a refund, otherwise their ticket will be good for the rescheduled date. ""For cancelled shows, refunds will be automatically processed within 30 days, unless fans voluntarily opt into other programs,"" a statement from the company reads. ""Live Nation venues will offer fans an option to receive a 150% credit for the value of their tickets to be used for a future Live Nation show. Fans will also be able to donate the proceeds of their refund to a charity to give concert tickets to health care workers, with Live Nation matching ticket donations."" The refund plan comes after a month of negotiations with five major talent agencies -- WME, Paradigm, CAA, ICM and UTA -- scheduling meetings with the professional sports leagues looking to reschedule games in the buildings were the shows are set to take place and coordination with AEG who is going to offer refunds to its customers under the same terms and method as Live Nation. In total, Ticketmaster has already cancelled or postponed 30,000 events representing $2 billion in ticket sales and another 25,000 events that are still scheduled to take place through the end of year. Ticketmaster is expecting some of those events will be postponed or canceled throughout the year and will begin offering refunds on a rolling basis. Ticketmaster has come under fire for not immediately offering refunds after shows were postponed, but company officials tell Billboard the business doesn‚Äôt hold ticket sales money. Instead, it forwards the sales revenue to its clients, including promoters like Live Nation and AEG, who then pay deposits to talent agents for the artists booked to play shows. Under normal circumstances, most rescheduled shows have low refund rates, but Live Nation isn‚Äôt sure what is going to happen when fans -- some badly in need of cash -- are given the chance to receive refunds on their tickets. AEG and Live Nation had to work through thousands of tour deals to lower the risk for shows they‚Äôve already paid artist guarantees on and find ways to share any downside with artists. While the negotiation played out, a drumbeat of criticism against the company began to build as it worked through the complex logistics of canceling and rescheduling what was supposed to be the busiest summer in live music ever. Sources say Live Nation was hesitant to detail the refund efforts because it didn‚Äôt want to negotiate with artists and clients in the press. But as the company stayed tight-lipped, a narrative that Ticketmaster wasn‚Äôt going to offer any refunds began to develop and politicians like congress members like freshman Katie Porter (D-CA) and longtime critic Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) accused Live Nation of taking advantage of the pandemic in the interest of profit. From there Ticketmaster will work with venue and promoter clients that have postponed shows, although a source tells Billboard clients have the ultimate say on whether to offer refunds for shows that have been moved to another date. Ticketmaster will encourage venues to offer refunds for a limited window -- the company wants to avoid scalpers dumping large blocks of tickets days before a show because the tickets weren‚Äôt fetching a high retail price. The large refund effort should cover most concerts and festivals through July. Tickets for events in August and the fall that haven‚Äôt been canceled will be addressed at a later date, if the shows do end up having to be rescheduled or terminated.

Eventim sells tickets to concerts from the Red Hot Chili Peppers to Iron Maiden. Based on several refunds, reviewed by MarketWatch, for events in the U.K. in the coming months, Eventim would keep between 12%-14% of the price paid by consumers.  Ticket holders will lose out as the company says its ‚Äòprocessing and service‚Äô fees are nonrefundable, leading to accusations on social media that the company is profiteering from the crisis. Eventim confirmed customer refunds only included the face value of the ticket and not fees paid. It declined to comment when asked how much money it would retain from canceled events.  A spokesman for Eventim said: ‚ÄúIf the respective organizer has canceled the event and has commissioned us to reverse the ticket costs, we will immediately refund the ticket costs to the customer. The fees are for services already provided, such as shipping, packing, administration.‚Äù For one show at the Eventim Apollo theater, which seats 3,500, a customer was refunded ¬£11 less than they paid for each ticket, meaning Eventim could keep tens of thousands of pounds for an event that won‚Äôt happen.  LiveNation        LYV,         +0.22%      owned Ticketmaster, the biggest event ticketing company in the world, is offering full refunds to ticket holders for events canceled by coronavirus, including service fees, a spokesperson confirmed. Walker said he believes companies currently withholding full refunds will face a backlash from customers when they start buying tickets again. The Ticket Factory is another of Eventim‚Äôs competitors offering full refunds. It said: ‚ÄúTicket buyers are entitled to a full refund minus any postage costs where the tickets have already been posted.‚Äù He believes falling back on the often unread terms and conditions is unfair and many other ticket sellers are refunding customers the full amount paid. ‚ÄúSome booking fees can be up to 20%,‚Äù he said. Read:Airlines are issuing billions of dollars in vouchers ‚Äî but can you still get a cash refund for coronavirus-related flight cancellations? Thousands of events around the world have been canceled as social distancing rules prohibit large gatherings. Eventim‚Äôs terms and conditions read: ‚ÄúIf an event is postponed or canceled, you are entitled to a refund. This refund is for the face value of the tickets only and does not include the fees paid.‚Äù The German government on Friday announced legislation to allow refunds to be made as vouchers. The Eventim spokesman said the full amount paid for the ticket, including service fees, would be reflected in the voucher, customers will have until the end of 2021 to use the voucher, at which point they would be entitled to a full refund. ‚ÄúMany events have been cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak, however if a ticketing company is selling to UK customers it must comply with UK rules around refunds and cancellation, even if their parent company is not based in the UK,‚Äù he said."

Ticketholders can get refunds for any show postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to its website. They will have 30 days to request a refund once shows are rescheduled.  If an event already has been rescheduled, ticketholders will have 30 days from May 1 to request a refund. A list of AEG Presents shows that already have new dates can be found here.  Tickets purchased after a rescheduled date is announced won‚Äôt be refunded.  The company will allow people to get refunds within 30 days of when a rescheduled date is set, Billboard reported.

When Lisa DeWitt reached out about a refund, she was told no refunds would be offered ‚Äî her tickets would instead be good for the 2021 festival. That original Facebook statement, which she‚Äôd screenshotted, was gone within 24 hours. ‚ÄúThese ‚Äòno refund‚Äô policies, when the event is rescheduled, are clearly noted on our ‚ÄòTicket Information‚Äô language on our website and was a condition of every online sale through Etix,‚Äù the festival‚Äôs website now states. With tens of thousands of concerts, festivals and sporting events shut down from March through the foreseeable future, many consumers are getting antsy about whether they can get refunds for their tickets. On April 17, Ticketmaster President Jarred Smith tweeted that the company does not ‚Äúintend to withhold refunds on postponed shows.‚Äù That has not stopped New York state officials from launching an investigation into whether the company subtly changed its refund policy in the wake of COVID-19. (The company has said it was a clarification, not a change.) And it has not stopped two members of Congress, Democrats Katie Porter and Bill Pascrell Jr., from calling upon Ticketmaster to refund everything. According to Variety, two major promoters, Live Nation and AEG, have initiated a refund program that will kick into place May 1. If a concert is canceled, fans will either be automatically refunded, or in some cases must request a refund. If, however, a concert is postponed to a new date, ticketholders will have 30 days from that point to request a refund through Live Nation-owned sites (like Ticketmaster) or AEG-owned sites (like AXS). Ticketmaster has also said it will waive its seller fees for resale postings created through May 31. In an email, Tampa Bay Blues Festival president Charles Ross said the festival initially tried to refund buyers who couldn‚Äôt attend the rescheduled festival ‚Äúfor serious reasons like medical events, family commitments, etc.,"" but it became ‚Äútoo complicated to interface with the buyers, so we chose to follow our published procedures.‚Äù They did change their policies to allow ticketholders to resell passes to a third party. It doesn‚Äôt feel that way to DeWitt, who has started a private Facebook group, ‚ÄúTBBF We Want Our Refund,‚Äù for ticketholders to vent about the festival‚Äôs refund policy. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what next April is going to bring, and whether or not I can travel from Colorado,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI understand their plight, but they also publicize that they sell out their VIP tickets every year. So why can‚Äôt they just refund our money, like they said they were going to, and sell to someone else?‚Äù In general, tickets purchased for an event that‚Äôs been canceled can be refunded. For most online purchases, that will happen automatically, but it‚Äôs good to confirm that through the retailer or venue. Most tickets to postponed events will be honored on the new date. One caveat: Many organizations have closed or changed their box office hours; those that are open may be dealing with high call volume. And some venues require you to wait until a new date has been announced before inquiring about a refund. So if you can‚Äôt get answers immediately, be patient.

Florida Orchestra: The orchestra, like other nonprofits, is encouraging people to consider donating the cost of their ticket, or exchange it for credit for a future performance. But those specifically requesting refunds can get them by contacting (727) 892-3337 or ticketcenter@floridaorchestra.org. The Palladium: The St. Petersburg theater, like a lot of venues, is asking patrons to consider keeping their tickets, exchanging them for credit or donating the cost to its programs. But it is also allowing ticketholders to request refunds. Click here for details. Raymond James Stadium: Refunds are already available for the Sunset Music Festival (see below) and Tampa Bay Vipers.

Reggae Rise Up: Upon postponing their event from March until Oct. 2-4, the St. Petersburg reggae-rock festival announced there would be no refunds (which is in keeping with their normal rain-or-shine ticket policy).

For tickets bought online, most cancellation refunds are automatically processed to the same card used for purchase. Timing will vary; check with the ticket distributor to learn more.  Ticketmaster states that all refunds should be received within seven to 10 business days. StubHub is offering ticket-holders two options: a refund within two to three weeks of processing, or a StubHub coupon worth 120% of the initial purchase price, received in one to two days.  Once Eventbrite organizers begin the refund process, ticket buyers can expect to see the money within five to seven business days.

Joe x  We are very sorry to announce that we are no longer able to move forward with our South American and US tours planned in March & April.  With the postponement of both Lollapalooza and Coachella, we have considered all options to perform our own shows in these cities & still reach our fans, but with local advisories & restrictions in response to COVID-19, it is just not possible. Bans on some international travel have made it impossible for some members of our band & crew to travel to these countries. With these things so constantly changing, we cannot risk not being able to be at home to support and look after the more vulnerable members of our communities and families. With these tours no longer being possible, we have absorbed a huge financial loss, and it has left us in a very challenging position, but we will be around to fight another day. For this, we feel very fortunate.

Also, our thoughts are with the venues, the independent companies, cafes, restaurants, record stores ‚Äì the list is endless. We encourage everyone to support each other, so we can weather this storm.  With regards to the Mexico tour, this is being assessed on a daily basis. If there is any way we can do shows, safely & responsibly, we always will. Individual festivals and shows will have specifics on any rescheduled or cancelled dates and information on refunds and tickets. Huge love and respect goes out to all the support and medical staff in our NHS and emergency services all around the world.

If your flight's still taking off and you're not on it, you're out of luck. The proposed law, backed by five Democrats ‚Äî¬† Edward J. Markey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kamala Harris of California ‚Äî would require both major carriers and third-party ticket sellers to offer full refunds, in cash, for any tickets canceled during the pandemic, whether it was the airline canceling the flight or an individual passenger deciding not to travel. Sen. Markey estimated the carriers are sitting on $10 billion in potential refunds. ""Airlines already have a moral responsibility to give cash refunds for all canceled tickets during the coronavirus pandemic,"" he said. ""People who bought flight tickets and don't get their refund may be in a situation where they suffer financially,"" said Christian Nielsen, chief legal officer at AirHelp. The Berlin-based firm, founded in 2013, has helped 16 million air travelers in 35 countries file compensation claims against global carriers under international regulations. In May, Consumer Reports, non-profit federation U.S. PIRG and Denver resident and airline customer Jen Stansfield delivered to major airlines a petition signed by nearly 250,000 demanding cash refunds for canceled trips. In fact, the National Consumer League, which has welcomed the proposed refund legislation, objected in a May 28 statement to proposed rules from the DOT that it said ""require the agency to overcome burdensome hurdles before any new enforcement actions or consumer protection rule makings are initiated."" An airline is a ""negative-working-capital business"" that finances operations on proceeds from future sales, Mann explained. If carriers are forced to refund in cash those future sales, even fares understood to be nonrefundable when purchased, ""there is effectively no limit on the amount of cash draw on an airline's balance sheet,"" he said. ""It's been said that we should ignore or change the current law and regulations so that any canceled any passenger cancels is entitled to a refund,"" he testified. ""I'll just lay it out there for you right now: Revenue, negative revenue, exceeds bookings."" Forcing cash refunds in all instances would lead to airline bankruptcies ""very quickly,"" Calio said. According to Airlines for America, as of May 19, U.S. airlines were ""collectively burning"" as much as $7.5 billion per month, with net passenger bookings down 92% and booked revenue down 100% year over year. Unlimited passenger refunds would also mean much of the federal aid in grants and loans to airlines might ironically ""end up going right back to consumers in the form of refunds,"" Mann said. Airlines normally don't like to make refunds of any kind, mandatory or not. In March and April, the Transportation Department received more than 25,000 complaints from consumers who said they had been denied refunds by carriers, according to The Washington Post. Even in overseas markets like the European Union that have stronger air passenger protections in place, airlines are resisting pandemic-related refunds, said Nielsen at AirHelp. ""What we're seeing here in Europe is that airlines aren't paying because they're struggling financially and it just doesn't make any sense for them to pay,"" he said. ""They would rather face a lot of negative media, political pressure and all kinds of other pressure than pay out."""

The DOT notes, that airlines have provided refunds during other periods when air travel was significantly disrupted, including following the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001 and Hurricane Katrina. ‚ÄúAlthough the COVID-19 public health emergency has had an unprecedented impact on air travel, the airlines‚Äô obligation to refund passengers for canceled or significantly delayed flights remains unchanged,‚Äù it states. A United customer who was recently denied a refund for three canceled flights totally $1,500 is suing the airline, whose official cancellation policy states that customers who do not want to reschedule their flight or get credit for a future trip may ‚Äúrequest a refund,‚Äù as of Tuesday, April 8. While it varies by cruise line, many companies are now offering two options for those who have a cruise booked during the suspension: a 100 percent cash refund, or the option to put the value paid towards a future cruise, with added incentives in the form of on-board credits. For canceled sailings, most companies currently have a refund request form handy on their website. Fans with tickets to concerts and shows that were originally scheduled for dates that have been impacted by the pandemic should check the performer‚Äôs social media accounts and official website for direct information on whether the performance has been canceled altogether, which will require a refund. Fans should also see if they have the option to keep their stub and use it to attend a rescheduled show date. Each entertainer and vending partner handles refunds differently, though generally if a show is canceled, a refund will be issued using the same method of purchase automatically. For those who purchased stubs from Live Nation to shows that have been canceled, fans will be issued a refund automatically. The official Live Nation site says that if an event is canceled or postponed: ‚ÄúWe will attempt to contact you to inform you of refund or exchange procedures for that event. For exact instructions on any canceled or postponed events, please check the event information online or contact us. If an event is canceled, and you purchased your ticket through Livenation.com, our phone center, or Fan-to-Fan, we will automatically issue you a refund to the credit card, debit card, gift card or the method of payment used to make your purchase.‚Äù For those that purchased tickets from Ticketmaster, the vendor plans to keep in touch and released this update regarding cancellations and postponements: ‚ÄúAs we receive updates from artists, teams and show organizers on their postponed and rescheduled events, as well as their individual refund policies, we will be providing fans with the latest news on their event status via this comprehensive information portal. For events in Canada, please click here.‚Äù Ticketmaster will also issue refunds to individuals with tickets to canceled shows, but notes that return funds may take up to 30 days due to the unusually high volume of cancellations. ‚ÄúAs always, canceled events are automatically refunded. If an event organizer is offering refunds for postponed or rescheduled events, a refund link will appear on your Ticketmaster account. Otherwise, you are encouraged to periodically check back online to see if the status of their event has changed.‚Äù Ticketmaster recently updated the wording of its refund policy for postponed events. According to an image captured by the The New York Times, a page on Ticketmaster‚Äôs website used to read that refunds ‚Äúare available if your event is postponed, rescheduled or canceled.‚Äù Now, the page has been reworked to say that refunds ‚Äúare available if your event is canceled.‚Äù Ticketmaster‚Äôs Purchase Policy states that ‚Äúthe Event Provider may set refund limitations,‚Äù and in a statement to USA TODAY, the company said its policy on postponed events has been consistent, though its wording online has been edited for clarity. The publication added that in the statement, Ticketmaster said that the refund policy for postponed events has always been set by event organizers ‚Äî not by Ticketmaster. When it comes to tuition, it seems the majority of colleges and universities aren‚Äôt offering full refunds. However, many of them are offering reimbursements to their students in other ways. At Stanford University, for example, students have been offered a full refund on housing and dining charges for the spring semester. Stanford also covered airline tickets and travel expenses for students who receive financial aid, with an additional $2,000 allocated into their packages for at-home food, living and additional rent expenses. Harvard University also established an emergency financial aid fund to pay for the travel arrangements of students who cannot afford to return home, and is offering prorated refunds for housing and dining plans. Similarly, The Ohio State University, the University of California, San Diego, Florida State University, Columbia University and the University of Wisconsin are giving prorated refunds for housing and dining, with UCSD offering a 60 percent tuition refund to students who applied before March 22. Northern Illinois University, Cornell University, and the University of Arizona are among the many institutions giving students credits for the spring semester room and board costs. For seniors who are not returning next year, schools like the University of Dayton, will offer a prorated housing and meal-plan credit ‚Äî both of which can go toward any outstanding balance owed to the university or simply, a full refund. Daycares, nursery schools, and private schools have also instituted similar reimbursement practices. For example, the Montessori School in San Antonio is offering parents the option to appeal for relief of up to 50% of tuition for the closure period and giving refund checks for lunch and milk/juice orders. For those whose weddings or special events have been impacted by the coronavirus, the disappointment of not being able to celebrate as planned with loved ones compounds the potential financial loss. But there are several things would-be-newlyweds should know about postponing their event or getting refunds from vendors and venues. ‚ÄúDepending on why an event is cancelled usually dictates how refunds are handled, along with the specific terms of the contract, which vary from venue to venue and vendor to vendor,‚Äù Leah Weinberg, owner of Color Pop Events and a former lawyer tells PEOPLE. ‚ÄúIf you obtained event insurance before COVID, look at the refund policies. And push back if the insurance company denies you,‚Äù she says, noting that most insurance companies are now exempting COVID-related delays and cancellations for new policies. Fox also points out that it maybe easier to get refunds from certain types of vendors. A florist, for example, will have already put in plenty of work on your event beforehand and will definitely expect to be paid for that time. ‚ÄúCompare this to a transportation company, who may not have done any upfront work aside from performing the actual booking process,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúA full refund is more likely in a situation where there has been no behind-the-scenes work.‚Äù"

When Lisa DeWitt reached out about a refund, she was told no refunds would be offered ‚Äî her tickets would instead be good for the 2021 festival. That original Facebook statement, which she‚Äôd screenshotted, was gone within 24 hours. ‚ÄúThese ‚Äòno refund‚Äô policies, when the event is rescheduled, are clearly noted on our ‚ÄòTicket Information‚Äô language on our website and was a condition of every online sale through Etix,‚Äù the festival‚Äôs website now states. With tens of thousands of concerts, festivals and sporting events shut down from March through the foreseeable future, many consumers are getting antsy about whether they can get refunds for their tickets. On April 17, Ticketmaster President Jarred Smith tweeted that the company does not ‚Äúintend to withhold refunds on postponed shows.‚Äù That has not stopped New York state officials from launching an investigation into whether the company subtly changed its refund policy in the wake of COVID-19. (The company has said it was a clarification, not a change.) And it has not stopped two members of Congress, Democrats Katie Porter and Bill Pascrell Jr., from calling upon Ticketmaster to refund everything. According to Variety, two major promoters, Live Nation and AEG, have initiated a refund program that will kick into place May 1. If a concert is canceled, fans will either be automatically refunded, or in some cases must request a refund. If, however, a concert is postponed to a new date, ticketholders will have 30 days from that point to request a refund through Live Nation-owned sites (like Ticketmaster) or AEG-owned sites (like AXS). Ticketmaster has also said it will waive its seller fees for resale postings created through May 31. In an email, Tampa Bay Blues Festival president Charles Ross said the festival initially tried to refund buyers who couldn‚Äôt attend the rescheduled festival ‚Äúfor serious reasons like medical events, family commitments, etc.,"" but it became ‚Äútoo complicated to interface with the buyers, so we chose to follow our published procedures.‚Äù They did change their policies to allow ticketholders to resell passes to a third party. It doesn‚Äôt feel that way to DeWitt, who has started a private Facebook group, ‚ÄúTBBF We Want Our Refund,‚Äù for ticketholders to vent about the festival‚Äôs refund policy. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what next April is going to bring, and whether or not I can travel from Colorado,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI understand their plight, but they also publicize that they sell out their VIP tickets every year. So why can‚Äôt they just refund our money, like they said they were going to, and sell to someone else?‚Äù In general, tickets purchased for an event that‚Äôs been canceled can be refunded. For most online purchases, that will happen automatically, but it‚Äôs good to confirm that through the retailer or venue. Most tickets to postponed events will be honored on the new date. One caveat: Many organizations have closed or changed their box office hours; those that are open may be dealing with high call volume. And some venues require you to wait until a new date has been announced before inquiring about a refund. So if you can‚Äôt get answers immediately, be patient. Here‚Äôs how some Tampa Bay venues and entities are handling ticket refunds. If there‚Äôs an organization not on this list, and you want to know whether you can get a refund, contact us here, and we‚Äôll try to add it. Amalie Arena: It‚Äôs a confusing time to be a ticketholder at Amalie Arena, between events being postponed, moved, canceled ‚Äî and then there‚Äôs the Lightning, who have their own ticket refund policy. The arena has outlined what‚Äôs going on with each of its events here. Florida Orchestra: The orchestra, like other nonprofits, is encouraging people to consider donating the cost of their ticket, or exchange it for credit for a future performance. But those specifically requesting refunds can get them by contacting (727) 892-3337 or ticketcenter@floridaorchestra.org. The Palladium: The St. Petersburg theater, like a lot of venues, is asking patrons to consider keeping their tickets, exchanging them for credit or donating the cost to its programs. But it is also allowing ticketholders to request refunds. Click here for details. Raymond James Stadium: Refunds are already available for the Sunset Music Festival (see below) and Tampa Bay Vipers. Refunds will be available for Kenny Chesney, once a new date is announced. The Rolling Stones, who have pushed back their July 5 show, have not yet announced whether refunds are available. Click here. David A. Straz Jr. Center for the Performing Arts: The Straz Center has always offered ticket refunds for canceled or postponed events, and is keeping that policy during the pandemic. Ticketholders may also choose to donate the value of their ticket to benefit an organization like Opera Tampa or the Patel Conservatory, or receive credit for a future show. Contact comments@strazcenter for more options. Click here for details. Tampa Theatre: At the moment, ticketholders may receive refunds for events that have been canceled. For events that have been postponed, they must wait for the new date before contacting the box office about refund options. In the meantime, contact gargoyles@tampatheatre.org for information. Click here for details. Sunset Music Festival: After the massive electronic music festival at Raymond James Stadium was postponed from May 23-24 to July 3-4, organizers promised ‚Äútickets will be 100 percent refunded in entirety, including service fees‚Äù ‚Äî but only until April 24. Click here for details. Tampa Bay Blues Festival: After initially announcing tickets to the 2020 event could be refunded, organizers decided that won‚Äôt be the case. They will, however, assist in reselling tickets for those who cannot attend on April 9-11, 2021. Click here for details. Reggae Rise Up: Upon postponing their event from March until Oct. 2-4, the St. Petersburg reggae-rock festival announced there would be no refunds (which is in keeping with their normal rain-or-shine ticket policy). However, because of some lineup changes for the new dates, organizers are allowing some ticketholders to swap their daily tickets as follows: Friday tickets may be swapped for Sunday tickets (and vice versa), and GA Friday-Saturday tickets may be swapped for GA Saturday-Sunday tickets (and vice versa).

Joe x  We are very sorry to announce that we are no longer able to move forward with our South American and US tours planned in March & April.  With the postponement of both Lollapalooza and Coachella, we have considered all options to perform our own shows in these cities & still reach our fans, but with local advisories & restrictions in response to COVID-19, it is just not possible. Bans on some international travel have made it impossible for some members of our band & crew to travel to these countries. With these things so constantly changing, we cannot risk not being able to be at home to support and look after the more vulnerable members of our communities and families. With these tours no longer being possible, we have absorbed a huge financial loss, and it has left us in a very challenging position, but we will be around to fight another day. For this, we feel very fortunate.  Our thoughts go out to everyone else who have found themselves in the position of lost work & income over the next few months, including all the hard-working touring crew and artists across the live industry. Also, our thoughts are with the venues, the independent companies, cafes, restaurants, record stores ‚Äì the list is endless. We encourage everyone to support each other, so we can weather this storm.  With regards to the Mexico tour, this is being assessed on a daily basis. If there is any way we can do shows, safely & responsibly, we always will. Individual festivals and shows will have specifics on any rescheduled or cancelled dates and information on refunds and tickets. Huge love and respect goes out to all the support and medical staff in our NHS and emergency services all around the world.
