# cancelled-covid-concerts

This repository contains scripts for scraping, analyzing, and visualizing the data contained in Billboard's article [Here Are All the Major Music Events Canceled Due to Coronavirus](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9323647/concerts-canceled-coronavirus-list). This dataset was used in a recently-submitted academic paper (which I will link to here if it is accepted!).

Its output is a novel dataset which contains cancellation information for nearly 300 concerts that were postponed, rescheduled, or cancelled during COVID-19. The dataset includes information related to the artist, the genre, the date of cancellation, and the refund approach of the event organizers. That dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/connorrothschild/cancelled-covid-concerts/tree/master/data/final).

Finally, that data was visualized in both R for static plots and D3.js for an interactive version. You can browse the static R plots [here](https://github.com/connorrothschild/cancelled-covid-concerts/tree/master/outputs), and the D3 visualization [here](https://connorrothschild.github.io/cancelled-covid-concerts/d3/).
